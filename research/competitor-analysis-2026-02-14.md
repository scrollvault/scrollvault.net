## Executive Summary

This analysis benchmarks ScrollVault's content against top MTG competitor sites (StarCityGames, MTGGoldfish, EDHREC) using 10 recent articles from the last 30 days. **Key findings:**

- **Our major gap:** Visual content. Competitors usecard images, videos, data charts, and interactive decklists. We use only placeholder images.
- **Length mismatch:** Competitor average 1,200-3,500 words; our posts average 900 words.
- **Formatting strength:** Competitors excel at structured decklists with export functionality. We have basic markdown.
- **Engagement drivers:** Competitors embed videos, use interactive elements, and include social proof (comments, shares). We have none.
- **Opportunity:** We can differentiate with more narrative storytelling (like Garruk post) while adopting competitor best practices for data presentation.

## Article-Specific Gap Analysis

### Our "Izzet Prowess" vs. Competitor Deck Techs

**Our post:**
- ~750 words
- 3 placeholder images (no actual card art)
- Decklist in plain text
- Sideboard guide in bullet points
- No video
- No interactive elements
- Generic authorless voice

**StarCityGames "Spike Feeders" deck tech:**
- ~3,000 words + video transcript
- 0 images but **embedded 1-hour video**
- **Three separate decklists** with interactive export buttons
- **Every card name links to search** - readers can instantly buy/price check
- Deck submission credits ("Submitted by Patrick")
- Multiple archetypes compared
- Clear sections: Creatures, Planeswalkers, Lands, Spells, Sideboard

**EDHREC "Fire and Ice" deck tech:**
- ~1,900 words
- **Card images inline** for every card discussed
- Proprietary **Fire/Ice scores** showing trending data
- **Hyperlinked card names** to EDHREC database
- Data-driven recommendations ("this card gaining 5% inclusion")
- Strong author voice and transparency about methodology

**Our advantage:** Our sideboard guide is actually quite good - more detailed than competitors' typical sideboarding notes. We should keep that format.

**Critical gaps to fix:**
1. No actual card images (placeholders hurt credibility)
2. No video component (deck techs without video are now table stakes)
3. No interactive decklist export
4. No clickable card links
5. No author byline establishing expertise

---

### Our "TMNT Previews" vs. Competitor News

**Our post:**
- ~1,000 words
- 2 placeholder images
- Straight news summary
- Good meta description
- No embedded videos

**StarCityGames "TMNT Previews Start Tuesday":**
- ~200 words (much shorter!)
- No images
- **Embedded YouTube video** from The Command Zone
- **Links to official Wizards announcement**
- Gets straight to the point - minimal fluff

**Insight:** For pure news briefs, SCG keeps it ultra-concise. They use embedded video to add value without writing long form. Our TMNT preview is more detailed but less scannable.

**Our TMNT Bundle Delay:**
- ~1,100 words
- 3 placeholder images
- Good explanatory journalism
- No video
- No embedded social media reactions (just described)

**Competitor equivalent:** SCG doesn't have a direct match, but their B&R announcement includes **quotes from Gavin Verhey** and **links to original Wizards article**. We could embed tweet reactions or official Wizards statements.

---

### Our "Garruk Returns" vs. Competitor Speculative Analysis

**Our post:**
- ~1,000 words
- 1 placeholder image
- Strong narrative, lore-heavy
- No data/charts
- No card images (even hypothetical)
- No video

**Competitor parallel:** EDHREC's "Fire and Ice" uses data; SCG's Avatar business article uses financial data. No direct match for speculative lore content.

**Opportunity:** Our Garruk post is actually quite good - better than competitor equivalents because it's specialized. But we could enhance with:
- **Mock-up Garruk card** (designer collaboration)
- **Timeline graphic** of Garruk's appearances
- **Comparison table** of past Garruk cards
- **Video interview** with lore experts or designers

---

## Actionable Recommendations

### For Writer Agent (Drafting Phase)

1. **Minimum word count:** Target 1,200-1,500 words for deck techs, 800-1,200 for news, 1,500+ for deep dives.
2. **Structure templates:**
   - **Deck Tech Template:**
     - Opening hook (tournament result, metagame impact)
     - 200-word archetype overview
     - **Embedded video** (coordinate with designer for thumbnails)
     - Decklist with **clickable card links** (use Scryfall API)
     - **Key card analysis** (4-6 cards, 150 words each with inline images)
     - Mana base & sequencing tips
     - Sideboarding guide (table format for matchups)
     - **Proprietary metric** if possible (e.g., "Meta Relevance Score", "Power Rating")
     - Conclusion with tier placement
   - **News Template:**
     - 1-2 paragraph summary upfront (who, what, when)

   - Meta description: 150-160 chars with primary keyword + call-to-action
   - URL slugs: lowercase, hyphens, include primary keyword
   - Tags: 5-8 tags per post (format, archetype, set, mechanics)
   - Categories: "Deck Tech", "News", "Metagame Analysis", "Commander", "Standard", "Pioneer"
5. **Internal linking:** Link to our previous posts on same archetype/topic. Build content network.
6. **External linking:** Link to authoritative sources (Wizards announcements, MTGGoldfish meta, SCG tournament coverage). Use `target="_blank"`.
7. **Calls to action:**
   - End deck techs with "What's your take? Comment below" (if we enable comments)

### For Editor Agent (Formatting Rules)

1. **Markdown standards:**
   - Headings: `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3` (max 3 levels)
   - Decklists: Use code blocks with syntax highlighting:
     ````markdown
     ```mtg
     4 Monastery Swiftspear
     4 Soul-Scar Mage
     ```
     ````
   - Tables: Use pipe tables for sideboarding, matchup win rates
   - Bold for key terms: **monastery Swiftspear**, **prowess**
   - Italics for emphasis: *This card is meta-defining*
2. **Card name formatting:** Always link to Scryfall: `[Monastery Swiftspear](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Monastery+Swiftspear)`
3. **Image placement:**
   - Featured image at top (1200x630px for social sharing)
   - Inline images every 300-400 words
   - Alt text descriptive for accessibility
   - Captions with credit if needed
4. **Video embedding:**
   - YouTube/Twitch embed at 16:9 ratio
   - Place after intro or before key section
   - Add descriptive fallback text for accessibility
5. **Quote formatting:** Use blockquotes for expert commentary:
   `> "This card is format-breaking." – Gavin Verhey, MTG Designer`
6. **CTA styling:** Use button-like formatting:
   `[Download Decklist](#) {.btn .btn-primary}`
7. **Responsive design:** Ensure tables scroll on mobile, images scale.
8. **Reading time:** Calculate and display at top ("8 min read").
9. **Table of contents:** For articles >1,500 words, auto-generate from H2/H3s.
10. **Disclaimer:** Add standard "Prices/archetypes subject to change" footer.

---

### For Designer Agent (Image Creation Needs)

**CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Replace all placeholder images with actual card art and custom graphics.

1. **Card images:**
   - Source: **Scryfall API** (free, high-res, automatic). Build script to fetch card art by name.
   - Size: 300x420px for inline, 600x840px for featured
   - Format: PNG with transparency
   - Use for every card mentioned in deck techs (minimum 10-15 images per deck tech)
   - For cards not yet released (speculative): Create **mock-up template** with "Concept Art" watermark

2. **Custom graphics needed:**
   - **Mana curve charts:** Bar graph showing curve distribution (use Matplotlib/Python)
   - **Sideboarding guide matrices:** Table with matchup, +X/-Y cards, win rate delta
   - **Metagame share pie charts:** Archetype percentages
   - **Comparison tables:** Our card vs. alternative options with mana cost, power, synergy
   - **Timeline infographics:** For lore posts (e.g., Garruk appearances 2007-2026)
   - **Mana base breakdown:** Color pie showing % of each color source
   - **Card synergy diagrams:** Flowchart showing how key cards interact

3. **Video thumbnails:**
   - If we produce videos, create consistent template:
     - ScrollVault logo watermark
     - Archetype name in bold
     - Card art collage background
     - "Deck Tech" or "Meta Analysis" badge
   - Size: 1280x720px

4. **Social media images:**
   - Twitter/Facebook: 1200x675px summary graphic
   - Instagram: 1080x1080px square card collage
   - Include our branding (logo, colors)

5. **Branding consistency:**
   - Color palette: Define primary/secondary colors (currently none defined)
   - Fonts: Headings (Impactful), Body (Readable)
   - Logo placement: Top-left corner, minimal size

6. **Image optimization:**
   - Compress to <100KB for fast loading
   - Use WebP format with PNG fallback
   - Lazy loading for below-fold images

**Proposed image sourcing strategy:**
- **Automated:** Python script using Scryfall API to fetch card art by name from decklist. Run during build process.
- **Semi-automated:** Generate charts/graphs from data using Matplotlib/Seaborn templates.
- **Manual:** Custom illustrations (timelines, diagrams) - outsource to illustrator or create in Figma/Canva.
- **Placeholder policy:** **Never use placeholder images in final posts.** If image unavailable, omit or use generic "coming soon" graphic with clear messaging.

---

## Proposed Image Sourcing Implementation

### Automated Card Art Retrieval

```python
import requests
import os

def fetch_card_art(card_name, output_dir):
    """Fetch card art from Scryfall API"""
    url = f"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact={card_name}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        if 'image_uris' in data:
            img_url = data['image_uris']['png']  # high-res PNG
            img_data = requests.get(img_url).content
            filename = f"{output_dir}/{card_name.replace(' ', '_')}.png"
            with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
                f.write(img_data)
            return filename
    return None
```

Run this during post build to automatically download art for all cards in decklist. Cache locally to avoid repeated API calls.

### Chart/Graph Generation

Use Python's Matplotlib to create:
- Mana curve histograms
- Color distribution pie charts
- Metagame share over time line graphs

Template functions will accept data arrays and output branded PNGs.

## Competitive Positioning & Differentiation

**Where we compete directly:**
- **Depth of analysis:** Match SCG's deck tech thoroughness
- **Data credibility:** Match EDHREC's data-driven approach
- **Timeliness:** Match MTGGoldfish's rapid tournament coverage

**Where we can differentiate:**
1. **Narrative + data hybrid:** Our Garruk post showed strong storytelling. Combine this with SCG's decklist depth for a unique voice.
2. **Format-specific expertise:** Focus on Pioneer/Modern/Hi-Tech (not just Commander/Standard). SCG and EDHREC dominate those; we can own niche formats.
3. **Visual storytelling:** Invest in custom infographics and video content that competitors lack.
4. **Community integration:** Feature reader decklists, pro player interviews, event coverage that isn't just tournament results.
5. **"Why it matters" framing:** Connect cards to real-world play experience (e.g., "This card wins you games at FNM").

**Avoid:**
- Trying to beat SCG at their own game (they have 20+ years of brand trust)
- Trying to beat MTGGoldfish at pure data (they have sophisticated tracking)
- Trying to beat EDHREC at Commander (they have ~10x our database size)

**Instead:** Hybrid approach - our TMNT bundle delay was excellent business journalism. Do more of that: **why** things happen, not just **what** happens.

## Technical SEO Audit (Based on Competitor Best Practices)

| Element | Our Current State | Competitor Standard | Action |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| URL structure | `/posts/drafts/date-slug.md` (draft) | `/magic-the-gathering/article-slug/` | Implement clean URLs in production |
| Heading hierarchy | H1 → H2 → H3 (good) | H1 → H2 → H3 (good) | Maintain |
| Alt text on images | None (placeholders) | Descriptive (e.g., "Monastery Swiftspear card art") | Add alt text for all images |
| Internal links | None | 3-5 per article linking to related content | Add throughout |
| External links | Occasional | Frequent, authoritative | Increase to 5-8 per article |
| Meta description | Present but basic | Keyword-optimized, 150-160 chars | Rewrite for each post |
| Tags | Present but inconsistent | 5-8 specific tags | Standardize tag taxonomy |
| Schema markup | None | Article schema with author, date, image | Implement JSON-LD |
| Page speed | N/A (drafts) | Images optimized, lazy loading | Ensure <2s load time |

## Summary of Gaps & Urgency

**Critical (fix immediately):**
1. Zero actual card images - destroys credibility
2. No video integration - deck techs feel incomplete
3. No interactive decklists - loses engaged readers who want to play the deck
4. No clickable card links - readers have to manually search
5. No author branding - builds no personal authority

**High (fix within 2 weeks):**
6. Word count too low for competitive deck techs
7. No data tables/charts - less persuasive
8. No engagement features (comments, shares) - no community building
9. Inconsistent formatting - need templates

**Medium (fix within 1 month):**
10. SEO elements need optimization
11. No proprietary metrics - harder to differentiate
12. Limited multimedia - no podcasts, video series
13. No social media assets - shares feel unprofessional

## Success Metrics (30-60-90 Days)

- **30 days:** 100% of posts include actual card images + clickable links; avg word count 1,200+
- **60 days:** 50% of deck techs have embedded videos; 2+ custom graphics per post; average engagement rate (comments/shares) >2%
- **90 days:** 30% increase in organic traffic; 50% increase in average time on page; first external links/citations from other MTG sites

---

## Conclusion

ScrollVault has strong narrative foundations (Garruk post proves this) but lags far behind competitors on **visuals, interactivity, and data presentation**. The single biggest lever for improvement is **implementing card art and interactive decklists immediately**. Editor and designer agents must work in lockstep to produce **beautiful, functional, data-rich content** that matches StarCityGames' depth while maintaining our unique voice.

**Do not publish another deck tech without:**
1. Actual card images (no placeholders)
2. Clickable card links to Scryfall/TCGplayer
3. Interactive deck export button
4. Author byline with title
5. Minimum 1,200 words
6. At least one custom graphic (chart, mana curve, or comparison table)

Competitors have set the standard. Our content will look amateur until these basics are implemented.
