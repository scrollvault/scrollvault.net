  "body": "<h2>What Is the Arena Limited Championship Qualifier?</h2><p>The qualifier is a limited competition run directly through MTG Arena. Players will compete in Best-of-One Player Draft queues, with top finishers earning entry tokens toward the 2026 Arena Limited Championship, which then qualifies players for the 2027 Magic Limited Championship. This is the first time limited has had a structured path like this—previously, only constructed formats offered clear qualification routes. Wizards is finally acknowledging that limited skill matters at the highest level. For those of us who love the variance and puzzle of drafting, this is huge. It means your 1000+ limited games aren't just for fun—they're building a résumé for the big leagues.</p><h2>Why This Matters for Arena Limited Grinders</h2><p>Let's be real: constructed players have had all the spotlight. Championship Points, Pro Tours, Worlds—it's all been about your decklist, not your draft. Limited players have been relegated to side events or \"just for fun\" queues. This qualifier flips the script. Now, if you're the type who can curve out with efficient creatures and know how to go wide on turn 5, you can compete for prizes and a shot at the 2027 Magic Limited Championship. It's a validation that the skills you've honed cracking packs—evaluating cards, reading signals, building decks with high threat density—actually matter in the competitive ecosystem. I think it's nuts that we've waited this long, but better late than never. I'm thrilled because it might finally give limited specialists the recognition they deserve. And who knows? Maybe the next major limited event will see more draft-first picks like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse or Atraxa, Grand Unifier dominating the pod.</p><h2>How to Qualify and What's at Stake</h2><p>The qualifier structure features two Best-of-One Draft events running simultaneously. Players enter Draft One (25,000 Gold or 5,000 Gems) and aim for 7 wins. Earning 7 wins grants an entry token to Draft Two. Draft Two (entry by token) awards prizes including gem payouts and, for 5+ wins, cash prizes ($1,000 for 5 wins, $2,000 for 6 wins) plus an entry token to the 2026 Arena Limited Championship. The top performers will qualify for the Arena Limited Championship, which qualifies approximately 120 players for the 2027 Magic Limited Championship. A solid prize structure with real cash on the line gives limited grinders something to play for beyond personal satisfaction. The key is to show up, play your best limited, and hope you top-deck when it matters. If you brick on draw, that's tough—but that's limited. Bring your A-game and some gas.</p><h2>TMNT Preorder Bundles: Collectors, Rejoice</h2><p>In the same announcement, Wizards revealed two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles preorder bundles, each priced at $49.99. The Pack Bundle includes the Raph & Leo, Sibling Rivals sleeve, 45 TMNT packs, 5 mythic packs, and Leonardo and Raphael cards with depth art styles. The Play Bundle includes the Mikey & Don, Party Planners sleeve, a Splinter companion, 4 Player Draft tokens, 2 Sealed tokens, 20 Play-In Points, and Donatello and Michelangelo cards with depth art styles. Both bundles release March 3 ahead of the full set launch on March 6. These are aimed at collectors and fans of the crossover. While they don't directly impact limited play (unless the TMNT set launches into Arena draft soon), they're a neat addition for those who want to rep their favorite turtles. I'm not sold on dropping fifty bucks for sleeves, but the promo cards might be must-have if they're playable. Keep an eye out for the full card reveals—there could be some limited-only bombs.</p><h2>Final Thoughts: Time to Grind</h2><p>The bottom line: this weekend is the first taste of Arena limited as a true competitive path. Limited grinders, this is your moment. Fire up MTG Arena, register for the qualifier, and see if you have what it takes to make it to the Arena Limited Championship. I'll be there on the play, trying not to brick my draws and hoping to slam Sheoldred if she wheeled my way. Good luck, and may your packs be gas.</p>",
