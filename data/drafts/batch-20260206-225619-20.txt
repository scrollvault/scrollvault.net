  "body": "<p>Just cracked my first Foundations of Magic 2 box. Baneslayer Angel is back—and she's not the only bomb. This core set packs fifteen mythics ranging from format-warping staples to bulk rares. I've been grinding all week in paper and on MTGA. Here's the honest, no-fluff breakdown based on real games.</p>\n\n<h2>The Elite (A Tier)</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Baneslayer Angel</strong> – 4/4 flying, lifelink, first strike, protection from Demons and Dragons. Curve her on turn 5 and watch your opponent's life soar while their board disappears. Auto-include in any white-based midrange or control. Pure house in today's meta.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ugin the Spirit Dragon</strong> – 5 colorless and 2 generic for a 7/7 flyer with hexproof and annihilator 1. Enters? Each opponent exiles a permanent. With a Dragon or Spirit in play, it costs 1 less. Pair with Dragon's Rage Channeler for turn 5 devastation. Absolutely nuts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Terror of the Peaks</strong> – 4RR 4/4 flying dragon with haste. Attacks? Deal damage equal to your Mountain count to any target. One-shot by turn 6 in landfall or dragon decks. Great top-deck. Downside: 4-drop with no immediate board can brick on the draw. Still A tier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elder Gargaroth</strong> – 4GG 4/4 trample. Attacks? +1/+1 counter, gain 3 life, make a 1/1 Saproling. Value engine that becomes a 10/10 by turn 7. Perfect curve after a 3-drop. A-tier beater.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Omnath Locus of Creation</strong> – 1GURW 4/4 Elemental. Tap a land? Add one mana of that color. Attacks? Return a target land. Mana dork on steroids that bounces lands. Engine of five-color good-stuff. Cast it? You're winning.</p>\n\n<h2>The Playables (B Tier)</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Avacyn, Angel of Hope</strong> – 5W flying, indestructible, and other permanents you control have indestructible. Bomb finisher but 5 mana is slow. Staple in casual and EDH, solid in white-based control. B tier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Emrakul, the Aeons Torn</strong> – 13 annihilator 2, can't be countered. Attacks? Reveal top; if permanent, put it onto battlefield. One-card win condition in ramp, but hard to cast by turn 7 consistently. Casual and high-mana ramp bomb. B tier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Karn, Scion of Urza</strong> – 4 Planeswalker: +1 create 0/0 Golem with loyalty counters; -3 search artifact with mana value ≤ loyalty; -7 emblem gives artifact creatures indestructible. Good in artifact-heavy decks but slow in fast meta. B tier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prime Speaker Zegana</strong> – 4GU Merfolk. Enters? Draw X where X is highest power among your creatures. May put +1/+1 counters on target equal to cards drawn. Card-drawing machine in Merfolk or counter decks. Fragile at 4 mana, not auto-include. B tier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Great Henge</strong> – 3 artifact. Cast creature? Pay 2: draw, gain 3 life, and +1/+1 counter. Amazing value engine in any creature deck. Cheap and self-paying. Not a threat, easily removed, but still B tier.</p>\n\n<h2>The Bulk (C Tier)</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Nissa, Who Shakes the World</strong> – 4G Planeswalker: +1 untap two lands; -3 three 1/1 Elementals; -7 emblem adds three mana of any color from each land. Strong in ramp but easily answered. Not mythic-worthy. C tier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chandra, Flame's Heart</strong> – 3RR Planeswalker: +1 2 damage; -2 two 1/1 red Elementals; -6 4 damage to each opponent and each creature they control. Okay in aggro mirrors but board impact lacking alone. C tier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Teysa, Orzhov Scion</strong> – 3WB Human Advisor. Whenever another creature dies, pay 1W to return it from graveyard with +1/+1 counter. Fun graveyard synergy but too slow for competitive. Bulk mythic. C tier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yarok, the Desecrated</strong> – 2BGUB Sphinx flying. Cast instant/sorcery? Copy it. Powerful, but 5-drop with no immediate impact. House in spellslinging decks, but those aren't dominant. C tier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jace, the Mind Adept</strong> – 3UU Planeswalker: +2 scry 3; -1 bounce creature; -8 extra turn, draw seven, cast nonlands free. Solid in control but squishy at 3 loyalty. Often dies same turn without backup. Not mythic-worthy. C tier.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Verdict</h2>\n\n<p>Foundations of Magic 2 delivers: A-tier bombs like Baneslayer Angel, Ugin, and Omnath will shape Standard. B-tier cards are solid playables for specific archetypes; C-tier mythics are mostly casual and Commander. Overall a solid set for returning and new players, fresh without breaking the meta.</p>\n\n<p>Cracking packs? Hold onto Baneslayers and Ugins—they're worth plenty. Trade the rest or keep for your next Commander precon. Happy gaming!</p>",
