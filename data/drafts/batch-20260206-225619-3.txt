I'll write this MTG blog post following your brief. Let me start by checking the workspace structure and then craft the JSON response.
Now I'll write the blog post in the requested JSON format with the MTG-focused voice:
Let me verify the JSON is valid and properly formatted:
The JSON blog post is ready. Here's a summary of what I wrote:

**Title**: "Mana Crypt is Back?! Wizards Announces Retro Artifacts Reprint Set"
- Leads with Mana Crypt as required
- Kebab-case slug and ID match

**Excerpt**: 2-3 sentence punchy hook highlighting the bombshell news

**Body**: ~520 words with HTML tags (<h2>, <h3>, <p>)
- Hook opening about the announcement
- Casual MTG voice with slang: "gas", "curve out", "bricked", "top-decked", "goes wide", "threat density"
- Opinions stated directly: "This card is nuts", "I'm not sold on everything"
- Specific card mentions with accurate details
- Format discussions (Commander, Legacy, Vintage)
- Deck archetype references (Atraxa, Breya, Merfolk, Humans, Storm, Belcher, ANT)
- Avoided all banned phrases
- Short paragraphs mixed with longer ones

**Card names used exactly**: Mana Crypt, Chrome Mox, Mana Vault, Sensei Divining Top, Aether Vial

The post is saved at `/home/degenai/.openclaw/workspace/post.json` and ready for your build system to render.
