I'll conduct a fresh search to check for any news that may have emerged today (Feb 8) since my last search this morning. Let me look for the most current information:
Based on my comprehensive search covering the past 24-48 hours, there is no breaking MTG news specifically today (Feb 8, 2026). The news cycle is dominated by anticipation for tomorrow's (Feb 9) Commander ban/rule change announcement. However, I've verified several significant developments:

      "category": "News",
      "summary": "Wizards of the Coast will announce Commander format changes on February 9 at 11 a.m. EST. The vague announcement from Weekly MTG suggests possible updates to the ban list, Game Changers framework, or a long-debated hybrid mana rule change that would allow hybrid cards in decks containing either color. This follows months of speculation and recent price spikes on banned cards like Jeweled Lotus (+167%), Sylvan Primordial (+530%), and Biorhythm (+440%). Community sentiment is divided, particularly regarding whether the color identity rules should be relaxed.",

      "summary": "Eduardo Sajgaliksecured 3rd place at Pro Tour Lorwyn Eclipsed with a pure Elementals deck containing 27 Elemental creatures, ending an 18-year drought for typal strategies in Pro Tour Top 8s. The deck leveraged new cards like Flamebraider, Ashling Rekindled, Sunderflock, and the Incarnation cycle.

  "scout_notes": "No genuine breaking news today (Feb 8). The entire MTG community is focused on tomorrow's (Feb 9, 11 a.m. EST) Commander announcement. All major news sites are in speculation/analysis mode. The most recent substantive official content is the Feb 2 Arena announcements and the late-Feb 3 competitive play structure article. The Pro Tour concluded last weekend, and decklist analyses are still emerging. Community finance discussions are dominated by Commander speculation. Consider holding a follow-up scout immediately after the ban announcement to provide immediate analysis of actual changes vs. speculation."

**Note:** I've included 5 stories because all carry significant relevance. The commander announcement story is top priority given its imminence. The official competitive play announcement (magic.gg) is fresh news that hasn't been widely covered yet. The Pro Tour Elementals story, while from the weekend, represents a major meta shift that deserves coverage beyond simple results. The Arena policy change and draft guide provide practical value for players.
