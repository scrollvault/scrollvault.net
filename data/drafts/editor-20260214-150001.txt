  "body": "<h2>The Countdown Is On: TMNT Previews Start Feb 17</h2>\n<p>Alright, drop everything. Wizards just lit the fuse on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set, and the previews officially kick off on February 17 with live streams on Twitch and YouTube as part of Weekly MTG. I'm not gonna lie—I've been refreshing the Wizards news page like a maniac, waiting for this announcement. Now we have dates. The set launches March 6, 2026, and you can already preorder at your local game store or online. But the real fun starts next week when they start revealing cards. I'm talking about the turtles themselves: Leonardo, the Balance; Donatello, the Brains; Raphael, the Muscle; Michelangelo, the Heart; plus Splinter, the Mentor, and the partner card Heroes in a Half Shell. This is the crossover we didn't know we needed, and it's about to hit the table like a Craterhoof Behemoth on turn 5.</p>\n\n<h2>What Wizards Is Cooking (And Why It Matters)</h2>\n<p>Let's talk strategy. Wizards isn't just throwing cartoon characters onto cards for the memes. This is a deliberate cross-promotion play that makes sense for both Magic and the TMNT brand. They're tapping into nostalgia while pulling new players into the hobby. Smart. The announcement also mentions The Command Zone's coverage, which means we're going to get deep dives on the cards, probably some gameplay videos, and maybe even a spicy deck tech or two. That's huge because The Command Zone has a massive audience—many of those viewers might walk into a game store for the first time asking about Commander.</p>\n\n<p>The set itself is scheduled for March 6, but the previews starting February 17 will reveal the commons and uncommons first. That's unusual—usually we get rares and mythics early. This suggests Wizards wants to build steady hype rather than one big splash. I'm not sold on that approach yet; it might water down the excitement. But if they've got some truly broken commons, like a zero‑mana counterspell that exiles, we'll know soon enough. The commons/uncommons are the backbone of Limited, so revealing them early gives us a sense of the format's shape before the big cards drop.</p>\n\n<h2>The Set Breakdown: Release Date, Preorders, and What to Expect</h2>\n<p>Here's the practical stuff: March 6, 2026, is the official release date. Preorders are already live at your local game store and online retailers. That means if you want a booster box or the Turtle Power! Commander deck, you should put in your order now—especially after that NA bundle delay news we just got. I'm telling you, don't sleep on this. The bundles might be late, but the individual products should hit shelves on time. And if you want to play in the prerelease, that's February 27, so mark your calendar.</p>\n\n<p>What can we expect from the mechanics? The brief doesn't say much, but given the theme, I'd bet on ninja tribal, equipment synergy, and maybe a \"Shell\" mechanic or something that cares about having multiple commanders. The Heroes in a Half Shell partner card suggests a multicolor approach—probably green/white or blue/red depending on the turtle. Wizards has been pushing partner commanders hard lately, so this fits right into that design space. I'm hoping for some sweet card draw options that scale with the number of turtles you control. Turn 3 you slam a turtle, turn 4 you're swinging for 8 with equipment buffs—that's the dream.</p>\n\n<h2>The Turtle Power Commander Deck: Your First Look</h2>\n<p>The Turtle Power! Commander deck is the star of the show. It's a ready-to-play 100-card precon featuring all five turtles plus Splinter. The fact that each turtle is a legendary commander means you can pick your favorite and run it solo, or use Heroes in a Half Shell as a partner to mix and match. That's insane value. I'm particularly curious about Leonardo, the Balance. The name suggests something about parity—maybe an ability like \"If you control an even number of creatures, draw a card\" or \"Whenever you gain life, target opponent loses that much.\" That could be gas in a midrange shell. Donatello, the Brains clearly points to artifact shenanigans—maybe scrying, artifact recursion, or even a mini‑Tezzeret vibe. Raphael, the Muscle is probably a big beater with menace or doublestrike. Michelangelo, the Heart likely gives lifegain or protection. And Splinter, the Mentor will probably buff your ninjas or give them training. All these legends share the ninja typeline, so you can load up on ninja synergies from previous sets. This deck is going to be a blast right out of the box.</p>\n\n<h2>Should You Care? Here's My Take</h2>\n<p>If you're a Commander player, this is an automatic buy. The partner mechanic alone gives the deck infinite replayability—swap out Heroes in a Half Shell for different partners, or change your turtle, and you've got a whole new archetype. The art is gonna be gorgeous, and the nostalgia factor is off the charts. Even if you're not a TMNT fan, the mechanics look solid. Wizards has been knocking precons out of the park lately, and this one is shaping up to be one of the best.</p>\n\n<p>For Limited players, the set's commons and uncommons will dictate the format. We'll see those starting February 17. Pay attention to the curve, the removal spells, and the evasive creatures. If the set curves out nicely and has enough gas, it could be one of the best Limited formats in years. I'm hoping for a good mix of aggro, midrange, and control—something that doesn't just go wide or just go tall, but forces you to adapt.</p>\n\n<p>And if you're on the fence because of the bundle delays, don't let that stop you. The set still launches March 6, and prerelease is February 27. Go to your local store, crack some packs, and enjoy the chaos. This crossover is a win for everyone—it brings new faces into our community, gives us killer cards, and maybe, just maybe, makes us all feel like kids again. Cowabunga, indeed.</p>",
