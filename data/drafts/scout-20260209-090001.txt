  "scout_notes": "The biggest story today is the imminent Commander banlist announcement (expected Feb 9). The massive price spikes on speculation show how influential these announcements are. The Roll for Initiative Secret Lair is also significant as it's one of the first D&D crossovers with art themed around specific Forgotten Realms locations. In Arena news, the sideboard change from 7 to 15 cards for Best-of-One is a major format shift that will simplify deckbuilding. No major new set spoilers or additional ban list changes beyond Commander are trending."

Note: I am not reporting on the Regional Championship details as they're 6 days old and lower priority. The recent posts you listed already covered Secret Lair/D&D topics, but this new release is distinct from the previous D&D drops and includes significant reprints like Bloodletter of Aclazotz, so I've included it with a different angle focused on value and the specific terror-themed art.
