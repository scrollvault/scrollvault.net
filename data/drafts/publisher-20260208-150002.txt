I see the JSON was provided in the first message but the second one says "completed". I'll publish the Izzet Elementals post from the original message.

Let me check if that post ID already exists in the current posts:
The ID `izzet-elementals-end-18-year-typaldrought` doesn't exist in the current posts, so this is a new post. The post already has a proper `thumbnail_gradient` set, so I'll add it directly
