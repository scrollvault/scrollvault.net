  "body": "<h1>Mastering Tempo in Modern Murktide</h1>\n\n<p>You're on the play. Your opening hand: Island, Steam Vents, Murktide Regent, Counterspell, Mishra Bauble. Turn 1 you drop a land and pass. Turn 2 you slam Murktide Regent, but your opponent just resolves a threat and you're on the back foot. Sound familiar? This is the Izzet Murktide conundrum every pilot faces: when do you deploy your namesake creature?</p>\n\n<p>Murktide Regent isn't just a beater—it's the deck's win condition clock. But it's also a three-mana 3/3 with flying, which brick-walls your entire game plan if you can't protect it. Meanwhile, Dragon Rage Channeler is the card that makes the deck actually functional. It's the reason you can curve out and apply pressure early. Sequencing these two correctly separates the 5-0 grinders from the 2-3s at FNM.</p>\n\n<h2>The Dragon Rage Channeler Priority</h2>\n\n<p>Dragon Rage Channeler should be your first creature 90% of the time. Why? Because it scales. A 1/2 on turn 1 becomes a 4/4 by turn 3 if you've been casting instants and sorceries. That's a threat that trades up with most creatures in Modern. More importantly, it enables your other cards: it triggers Ledger Shredder, draws you cards, and pressures planeswalkers. Murktide Regent doesn't do any of that until it's already in play.</p>\n\n<p>Let's get specific. Turn 1: Island, play Dragon Rage Channeler. Opponent plays a creature? You can still cast your spells later that turn to grow it. Turn 2: You can slam a second Dragon Rage Channeler or hold up Counterspell. The option paralysis is real for your opponent.</p>\n\n<h2>When Murktide Regent Is Actually Correct</h2>\n\n<p>There are exactly three scenarios where you lead with Murktide Regent:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You have a hand with zero instants/sorceries and cannot meaningfully grow a Dragon Rage Channeler</li>\n<li>You are on the draw and your opponent's turn 1 play is a must-answer threat like a Tarmogoyf that you need to race immediately</li>\n<li>Your hand is so loaded with gas (multiple Counterspells, cheap spells) that you can protect Murktide Regent on the same turn</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That's it. Don't get cute. If you have any other spells in hand, wait on that Murktide Regent. The deck's core strength is its ability to generate advantage while applying pressure—Murktide Regent does neither on its own.</p>\n\n<h2>The Supporting Cast: Counterspell, Mishra Bauble, Ledger Shredder</h2>\n\n<p>Counterspell is your safety net. But here's the thing: holding up Counterspell every turn is how you lose to midrange decks that just deploy value creatures. You need to establish a board presence first. That's why Dragon Rage Channeler comes down before Counterspell gets its full value.</p>\n\n<p>Mishra Bauble might look like a cantrip, but it's actually your best defensive card. Turn 1 Bauble draws you a card and reveals their hand. If they're on a draw-go deck, you know exactly what to play around. If they have a threat, you can still cast your instants that turn to grow your Channeler. It's the glue that makes the deck flow.</p>\n\n<p>Ledger Shredder is underrated in this build. Every time you cast an instant or sorcery, you surveil 1. That's card selection, plain and simple. More importantly, it turns your cheap spells into damage. A Turn 1 Skeeter into Turn 2 two spells = a 2/2 Shredder that's already grown. It's a Must-Answer threat that demands removal, which means your Murktide Regent gets to live longer.</p>\n\n<h2>The Turn 3-4 Swinging for 8 Play</h2>\n\n<p>Here's the sequence that wins games:</p>\n\n<pre>\nTurn 1: Island, Dragon Rage Channeler\nTurn 2: Steam Vents, cast two cheap instants (Expressive Iteration, maybe a counterspell backup)\nTurn 3: Murktide Regent, attack with 8/4 flying Dragon Rage Channeler</pre>\n\n<p>Your opponent is already at 10. They have to answer two huge threats with one answer. They're dead on board. That's the tempo you're aiming for.</p>\n\n<p>If you lead with Murktide Regent on turn 3, you're attacking with a 3/3 while your Dragon Rage Channeler is still a 1/2. That's not good enough. The sequencing matters so much because it creates immediate board states that your opponent cannot easily answer.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Verdict</h2>\n\n<p>Izzet Murktide isn't a combo deck—it's a tempo deck that wins by being one step ahead. That means every decision about which creature to play first, which spell to hold, and when to cash in your advantage matters. Murktide Regent is the payoff, but Dragon Rage Channeler is the engine. Start the engine before you expect the payoff, and you'll find yourself consistently 2-0'ing your way through Modern.</p>",
