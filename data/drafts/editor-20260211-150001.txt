  "body": "<h2>Historic Just Got the Reax It Needed</h2><p>I've been yelling about Force of Negation in Historic since they banned it. \"It's too good for the format,\" they said. \"It warps blue decks,\" they said. Bull. Historic needed this. And now it's here. Wizards dropped a historic—literally—announcement that completely reshapes our format, and Force of Negation returning is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>The bans are clean: Eldrazi Temple, Ajani, Nacatl Pariah, Crop Rotation, and Scholar of the Lost Trove are gone. Good riddance. These cards created this awful meta where games were decided on turn 1. You either had the nuts or you folded. That's not Magic—that's a slot machine.</p><p>But the unbans? Oh man. Force of Negation, Force of Vigor, Endurance, Wilderness Reclamation, Magus of the Moon, Agent of Treachery. That's not just a toolbox—that's a full reactive suite. WOTC just handed us the tools to fight back.</p><h2>Why 'Solitaire Magic' Actually Dies Here</h2><p>Let's be real: Historic became solitaire. You ramp into Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger on turn 3 with Eldrazi Temple and there's literally nothing you can do. Crop Rotation into Orms-Gloves or Cavern of Souls? Same deal. The person who went first and drew the engine won before you could crack a land. That's garbage.</p><p>Force of Negation changes everything. Play against Amulet of Vigor? Now you can actually answer their payoff spell instead of just dying. Against Phoenix? Slap a Force on their key discard spell. Even against your own combo deck—oh wait, now you need to respect your opponent's counters. meta games get deeper immediately.</p><p>But it's not just Force. Endurance brings back those insane graveyard hate turns that actually punish the all-in dredge builds. Wilderness Reclamation means big mana decks can actually compete with the aggro onslaught. And Magus of the Moon? Blood Moon in Historic? That's the skill-testing manabase pressure we've needed forever.</p><h2>The Banned List Cleanup Was Overdue</h2><p>Eldrazi Temple had to go. I don't care if it's \"just a manabase.\" It wasn't. It was a ritual that cost zero. Turn 1 Temple into Simic Growth Chamber into Kozilek's Command? On the play? That's not interactive. That's vomiting your hand onto the table and hoping you're faster.</p><p>Ajani, Nacatl Pariah was the other plague. Four-mana Cats that generated advantage the moment they hit? In a format with Brainstorm and Ponder? No wonder every midrange deck was just 4-of this and 4-of that consistency engine. Good riddance.</p><p>Crop Rotation was the enabler for so many degenerate plays. Free land destruction. Free tutoring. It let decks play 5-color manabases with zero penalty. And Scholar of the Lost Trove? That was the ultimate consistency piece—cast any three-drop from your deck three turns early. Yeah, that needed to die.</p><h2>New Decks That Actually Exist Now</h2><p>I goldfished a Dimir Inverter of Truth list last night and went 5-0 in the playqueue. Force of Negation in the main means you can just say no to their removal while you combo off. Turn 1: Thoughtseize. Turn 2: hold up Force. Turn 3: Inverter and win. The math is so clean it feels illegal.</p><p>But the real brew I'm hyped about? Sultai Scapeshift with Wilderness Reclamation. Ramp into Reclamation on turn 4, then Scapeshift into a million lands and win. Or just cast Spring // Leaf earlier than ever. Reclamation creates actual comeback mechanisms in ramp mirrors—something that's been missing since Prophetic Prism rotated.</p><p>And Agent of Treachery unbanned? That's not just a value play—that's a win condition. Talk about slowing the game down. Now every midrange deck has to respect the possibility of their own creature getting stolen. Threat density matters more than ever.</p><h2>What This Means for Digital Eternal Formats</h2><p>Historic got complacent. We were stuck in this loop of \"unban the thing that breaks the format\" and \"ban the thing that's too consistent.\" This announcement shows WOTC is actually willing to give digital formats their own identity. They're not just dumping rotation-legal cards into Historic anymore—they're curating.</p><p>Force of Negation was always the test case. If it works here, what's next? Counterspell? Brainstorm? Maybe even Dark Confidant? The door is open now. They proved they'll unban cards that create actual decisions, not just raw power.</p><p>And the bans signal they're done with the free-ritual manabases. No more \"play this on turn 1 and do whatever you want.\" Future design for Historic might actually consider the format's health instead of just pushing new sets.</p><h2>The Meta's About to Get Real Fun</h2><p>I haven't been this excited to brew since the original Companion era. The old linear decks are dead. The new reactive toolbox is alive. Force of Negation in the main means every blue deck now has a tool for everything. Endurance means graveyard decks need to diversify. Magus of the Moon means you can't just play all the basics and call it a day.</p><p>Will some of these get banned again? Probably. Force of Negation is still nuts. But that's the point—we get to play with nuts stuff and actually answer it. That's Magic. That's what I signed up for. Not watching my opponent go off while I sit there with a hand full of creatures that attack for 2.</p><p>Scrollvault crew—fire up those deckbuilders. The new Historic awaits. And this time, it's got answers.</p>",

Also fixed spacing issue ('went5-0' → 'went 5-0'). Tone and structure already strong—minimal changes needed."
