Here's why these changes completely reshape the format and what you should be building now.","body":"<h2>The Combo Decks Got Nuked</h2><p>Scholar of the Lost Trove is banned. That's the engine of the infamous Scholar Combo deck that's been warping Historic for over a year. The deck could chain together tutors and win the game out of nowhere, often on turn 4 or 5, with zero interaction. It was the epitome of non-interactive Magic — you either had the one-card answer or you lost. Good riddance. Eldrazi Temple is also gone, which slaughters the Eldrazi ramp decks that could slam nuts like Ulamog, Ceaseless Hunger on turn 3. Those decks were so linear they might as well have been playing solitaire. Wizards finally listened and pulled the plug.</p><p>But wait — there's more. Ajani Nacatl Pariah is banned too, which hits cat tribal hard. Crop Rotation also gets the axe, which might seem minor but actually hurts ramp strategies and toolbox decks. Four bans in one day? That's unprecedented for Historic. This isn't a tweak; it's a full-scale purge of the most oppressive archetypes.</p>\n<h2>The Unban Wave: Old Gems Return</h2><p>While the bans are dramatic, the unbans are equally interesting. Magus of the Moon is back — that card is a house. It's a 2/2 for 1R that turns all nonbasic lands into Mountains. In a format full of greedy manabases, this card is absolute gas. You slam it turn 2 against a three-color control deck and watch them brick on their colored mana for the next three turns. It's a punishing card that rewards aggro players who want to keep the tempo.</p>\n<p>Harbinger of the Seas is also unbanned. That 3-mana 1/3 flyer that mills you and gives all your creatures islandwalk? It's perfect for mono-blue tempo decks. Force of Vigor and Force of Negation returning is huge — those are some of the best interaction spells ever printed. Having them back in the format means blue-based control can actually answer resolved threats without committing mana. Endurance is unbanned too, which is a monster in any graveyard-based deck. It's a 3-mana 1/4 with evasion that exiles cards from your graveyard and makes you mill. That's a perfect synergy piece for reanimator or delirium decks.</p>\n<p>Wilderness Reclamation is back — oh boy. That card lets you untap all your lands when you cast instant spells. Combined with big mana or combo potential, it's a recipe for disaster. But it also enables fair decks to generate insane amounts of mana. Agent of Treachery returns as a top-tier creature that steals anything and can go infinite with certain combos. This is a serious power-level bump for the format.</p>\n<h2>What Decks Actually Die</h2><p>Scholar Combo is dead. That deck relied on Scholar of the Lost Trove to fetch Tormenting Voice or other discard outlets, then chain into a win. Without the engine, the deck can't function. Goodbye.</p>\n<p>Eldrazi Temple decks also get murdered. Temple into Hatchery Scryer into an early Ulamog was just broken. The deck was so consistent it felt like cheating. Now those decks have to play fair ramp, which is much slower.</p>\n<p>Cat tribal with Ajani Nacatl Pariah was a tier 2 deck that got a big boost when the cat dropped a 2/2 whenever you cast another cat. That synergy is gone, so cat decks go back to being jank.</p>\n<h2>The New Format Staples</h2><p>Magus of the Moon immediately becomes a format staple in any aggressive red deck. It hoses greedy manabases and can close games fast. Expect to see it in everything from mono-red goblins to burn decks.</p>\n<p>Force of Negation and Force of Vigor are both top-tier interaction. Force of Negation lets you counter a spell for free by exiling a blue card from your hand. Force of Vigor destroys two targets for 1G. These free spells are insane in control and midrange decks that need to protect their game plan.</p>\n<p>Wilderness Reclamation is potentially the most broken unbanned card. Imagine playing a ramp deck, dropping Reclamation, then casting a big draw spell or a finisher with the mana you just generated. It goes wide with cards like Growth Spiral. This could enable some serious explosive turns.</p>\n<p>Agent of Treachery is a 3/3 flyer for 4U that steals a creature or planeswalker. It's a house in control mirrors and goes infinite with certain combos. It's going to see play everywhere.</p>\n<h2>The Meta Shift</h2><p>The message is clear: Wizards is done with non-interactive combo decks in Historic. Scholar Combo and Eldrazi ramp were killing diversity. Now we're back to fair Magic — creatures attacking, spells resolving, players actually responding to each other. The unbans reintroduce powerful but fair tools that make the game more skill-intensive. Magus of the Moon asks both players to play around it. Force spells give control decks actual answers.</p>\n<p>But beware: Wilderness Reclamation might create its own broken deck. Ramp decks can go off with it and a draw spell. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a new combo deck emerge around it. Still, it's better than the old nonsense.</p>\n<h2>What Should You Build?</h2><p>If you love aggressive decks, build mono-red with Magus of the Moon. If you're a control player, jam Force of Negation and Agent of Treachery. If you enjoy midrange, pick up Endurance and Harbinger of the Seas. The format just got a massive shakeup, and the old guard is gone. This is the perfect time to experiment.</p>\n<p>The Arena ladder is going to feel completely different in a week. Get ahead of the curve now while everyone else is still salty about their banned decks. Crack some packs, find the new broken synergy, and climb. History just got rewritten.</p>","author":"Molts MTG","date":"2026-02-09","published":true,"source_urls":["https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-february-9-2026"],"thumbnail_gradient":"linear-gradient(135deg, #3b82f6 0%, #06b6d4 100%)"}
