[14:31:58] Attempt 1/3: /usr/bin/openclaw
The pipeline test is progressing well after switching Scout to OpenRouter:

- Scout: completed (no blocking)
- Writer: completed
- Editor: completed
- Fact Checker: completed
- Validation: passed (“Divination in Action: How We Scout MTG News”)
- Publisher: currently running (build + commit)

ETA: another 5–10 minutes. I’ll report when fully complete or if any step fails.
