  "excerpt": "When Pack Rat hits the table, players can't hide their true colors. One grin means they're in black, a sigh says they're weak to flyers. Draft pods are full of tells—learn to read them and you'll draft better than 90% of players.",
  "body": "<p>You crack a booster at your local game store. The rares are spread out on the table, but your eyes lock on one: Pack Rat. Suddenly, the guy across from you leans forward, a grin spreading across his face. The woman to your left sighs, disappointed. That's not just a rare—it's a signal. And it's the first of many you'll get before the draft ends.</p><h2>Body Language: The Easy Reads</h2><p>Drafting is social. People give away tells without realizing it. Watch for the sigh of relief when a Baneslayer Angel appears—that player might be weak in the air, or they're scraping for win conditions. A sharp intake of breath when Iridescent Angel shows up? Someone's trying to figure out if they're in the market for a beater. Mulldrifter? That's pure gas for tempo decks. If your opponent perks up, they're probably in a tempo deck that wants to curve out. If they frown, they might be midrange and don't want to brick on four mana.</p><h2>Pick Order Tells a Story</h2><p>What cards someone takes—and in what order—reveals their strategy. If you see someone take Doom Blade over a better rare, they're probably committed to black and they know what's up: removal is gas in draft. Pack Rat early? They might be in a sacrifice or artifact synergy deck. The key is patterns. A player who consistently takes two-drops over bombs is playing aggressive. Someone who wheels a powerful card? Their neighbors are in those colors and the draft is shaping around them. Pay attention to who wheels what—that's free information.</p><h2>Signals in the Draft Pack</h2><p>The draft pack itself is a communication channel. When you see multiple Iridescent Angels in a pack, that's a sign the format's white is open. But also watch where they go: if the Angel wheels, white might be cut. Baneslayer Angel is a white-specific bomb—if it's being passed, either white is terrible or the player passing doesn't need it. Mulldrifter's a signal: blue decks want it, but it's also playable in many shells. If it's gone by pick 6, blue might be contested. Pack Rat is a classic sign that black/x decks are interested in synergy. Doom Blade's presence in a pack? If it disappears quickly, black's open; if it sits there, maybe black is dead at the table.</p><h2>Putting It All Together</h2><p>Start simple: note reactions when cards are opened. Then track pick orders over multiple packs. Within a few rounds, you'll have a read on each player's likely archetype. That lets you make decisions: if you're in colors that conflict with three players, pivot. If you see a player consistently passing certain cards, target those colors. The best drafters don't just draft good cards—they draft good cards in colors and archetypes that aren't being contested. That's how you curve out into a perfect curve while your opponents brick on three-drops. And remember: you're giving off signals too. Sometimes you'll mislead on purpose. Passing that Pack Rat after you've taken two black cards? That's a neat little bait. Use what you learn, adapt on the fly, and turn those reads into wins.</p>",
