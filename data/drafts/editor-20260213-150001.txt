  "body": "<h2>Turtle Power Has Landed</h2>\n<p>Brace yourselves, because Wizards just dropped the biggest crossover since, well, ever. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are officially invading Commander with the Turtle Power! precon, and I'm not gonna lie—I'm hyped. This 100-card ready-to-play deck features the four turtles as commanders—Leonardo, the Balance; Donatello, the Brains; Raphael, the Muscle; Michelangelo, the Heart—plus Splinter as the mentor figure, and the partner card Heroes in a Half Shell to tie it all together. It hits stores March 6, with the full set prerelease on February 27.</p>\n<h2>The Commanders: Meet the Turtles</h2>\n<p>Let's break down each legendary turtle and what they bring to the table. Leonardo, the Balance—yeah, that name suggests something about equality. I'm guessing an ability that cares about the board state being even, maybe something like drawing a card if you control an even number of creatures. Could be gas for midrange. Donatello, the Brains? That's clearly an artifact-themed commander. Expect some weird tech, maybe scry or artifact recursion. Raphael, the Muscle screams aggression—probably an expensive beater with menace or doublestrike. Michelangelo, the Heart—the name gives me protective vibes, maybe lifegain or giving creatures indestructible. And Splinter, the Mentor—this could be a support legend that buffs your ninjas or gives them training. Honestly, until we see the full text, it's all speculation, but the names are chef's kiss.</p>\n<p>Here's the kicker: they're all part of the same deck, so they're designed to work together. The precon will likely have a built-in synergy where each turtle supports a different aspect of the game, but they all share the ninja typeline. That means you can run all the ninja tutors, tricks, and equipment that the deck offers and have them all be relevant.</p>\n<h2>Partners in Crime: How Heroes in a Half Shell Works</h2>\n<p>The Heroes in a Half Shell card is the real genius here. It's a partner ability—meaning you can have it as a second commander alongside any of the turtles. That opens up a ton of flexibility. Want to lead with Leonardo but also have a partner that provides some extra card draw? Slap Heroes in a Half Shell as your second. It likely has an ability that benefits from having multiple commanders or from the turtle theme. Maybe it's a mana rock that gets better with each commander? Or it could be a creature that untaps when you activate a turtle ability. We'll have to wait for the full spoiler, but the design space is wide open.</p>\n<p>What this means for deckbuilding is you can choose which turtle to pair with the partner based on your preferred playstyle. If you want a more controlling game, pick Leonardo; if you want to go wide with Donatello's artifact shenanigans, pair it with that. The partner essentially gives the deck multiple commander options without buying multiple precons. That's huge value.</p>\n<h2>What to Expect From the 100</h2>\n<p>Wizards hasn't revealed the full list yet, but we can take an educated guess. This is a ready-to-play Commander precon, so it'll be tuned for a 7-8 power level—not cEDH, but not jank either. Expect a solid mana curve that actually curves out, a good mix of ramp and interaction, and a clear game plan. The turtle theme means lots of Ninja creatures, probably some Shells (get it?), and plenty of equipment to make the turtles look fresh.</p>\n<p>I'm predicting a midrange-combat based strategy: you develop a board of ninja creatures, equip your turtles with some sweet gear, and then swing for lethal. Turn 3 you slam a mana rock, turn 4 you drop a turtle, turn 5 you equip a Rogue's Gloves or something and start hitting. The deck will likely include some secret lair upgrades like the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cards that support the tribe. There's also a chance they include some crossover cards from previous sets, like Ninja of the Deep Hours or other ninja synergies.</p>\n<p>One thing I'm curious about: will they include any of the classic TMNT villains? Shredder, Krang, Foot Clan? That would add some fun interactions. Maybe they're saving those for a later set or a separate precon. Still, a deck full of heroes is a great start.</p>\n<h2>Why This Deck Slaps</h2>\n<p>Let's be real: crossovers can be hit or miss. But this one feels different. Wizards has been on a roll with their Universes Beyond collaborations, and TMNT is a perfect fit for Magic's creature-based combat and tribal mechanics. The art is gonna be insane—imagine Leonardo with a blue-white color scheme, Raphael all red and angry, Michelangelo green and goofy. It's a nostalgia bomb for sure.</p>\n<p>For Commander players, this is a solid precon that's likely to hold its value. Wizards' recent precons have been pretty well-built, and having a partner commander adds replayability. You can switch out the partner or even the turtle to create entirely new decks without buying new cards. That's smart design.</p>\n<p>And for TMNT fans who've never touched Magic? This could be their gateway. The theme is instantly recognizable, and the gameplay is straightforward: smash your opponents with your favorite heroes. It's a win-win that expands both audiences.</p>\n<p>I'll be picking this up day one. Anything that brings more people into the game while giving us a badass turtle deck is a win in my book. Cowabunga, indeed.</p>",
