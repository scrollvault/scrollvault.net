  ],
  "scout_notes": "The MTG news landscape is dominated by major business and format policy news rather than tournament results or card spoilers. The $500M lawsuit against Hasbro represents an existential threat to the secondary market's trust in the company's production practices. The Commander format is undergoing its most significant controversy in years with proposed unbans of Griselbrand, Iona, and Sundering Titan. Wizards' explicit denial of a Harry Potter set breaks their pattern of ambiguity on crossovers. The Companion App update represents the latest iteration of Wizards' digital ecosystem improvements. No major Pro Tour or Regional Championship results from the past72 hours were identified, suggesting the competitive calendar is in a quiet period between events."
