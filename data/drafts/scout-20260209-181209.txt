      "category": "News",
      "summary": "The February 9 B&R announcement brought sweeping changes to Historic on MTG Arena, banning Eldrazi Temple, Ajani Nacatl Pariah, Crop Rotation, and Scholar of the Lost Trove while unbanned Magus of the Moon, Harbinger of the Seas, Force of Vigor, Force of Negation, Endurance, Wilderness Reclamation, and Agent of Treachery. The changes target non-interactive combo decks and reintroduce land-hate tools to counter Eldrazi strategies.",

      "category": "News",
      "summary": "Necropotence has been restricted in Timeless format on MTG Arena, marking the format's first ever restriction. The card's dominance in Mono-Black combo decks, particularly after a strong showing at Arena Championship 10, prompted the action. The deck combines cheap interaction, fast mana, and two-card combos like Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord and Saint Elenda to win quickly.",

      "headline": "Commander B&R: Biorhythm and Lutri Unbanned, 'Banned as Companion' Category Created",
      "category": "News",
      "summary": "In a surprise move, the Commander Format Panel unbanned Biorhythm (with placement on Game Changers list) and Lutri, the Spellchaser, creating a new 'banned as companion' designation specifically for Lutri while allowing it in decks as commander. The panel also discussed but did not unban Sundering Titan, Iona, and Griselbrand, seeking community feedback. Notably, the widely-anticipated hybrid mana rule change was shelved indefinitely.",

      "category": "Strategy",
      "summary": "Despite pressure from the community, both Standard and Pioneer saw no changes in the February B&R update. Wizards praised Standard's diversity following Pro Tour Lorwyn Eclipsed, which featured seven different decks in the Top 8. Pioneer continues to evolve with Izzet Prowess/Lessons dominating MTG Arena while Magic Online shows more diversity. The formats are being monitored but require no intervention at this time.",

  ],
  "scout_note": "This was a massive B&R announcement day with significant changes across multiple formats. The Historic overhaul is particularly noteworthy as it represents a fundamental shift in philosophy—moving away from preemptive bans toward allowing clear counterplay cards. The creation of 'banned as companion' for Lutri is an innovative solution to a unique problem. Your recent posts covered the pre-announcement speculation (Prophet of Kruphix price spikes) and Secret Lair D&D drops, but the actual announcements are fresh and highly substantive."
