      "category": "Deck Guides",
      "summary": "Pro Tour Lorwyn Eclipsed showcased a remarkably diverse Standard format with no single dominant archetype, a stark contrast to the Izzet Lessons dominance that plagued 2025. The combination of targeted bans (Vivi Ornitier, Screaming Nemesis) and a strong typal-focused set has created a format where Elementals, Reanimator, and traditional strategies all thrive, with no additional bans expected for February.",

  "scout_notes": "The major story this week is the impending Commander ban announcement (Feb 9, 11 a.m. EST). The Pro Tour results generated excitement about typal strategies, but attention has shifted to speculation about which banned cards might return via the Game Changers system. Finance discussions are dominating social media as prices soar. In Standard, the format is in an unusually healthy state post-Lorwyn Eclipsed. No genuine breaking news today (Feb 8) - everything is anticipation for tomorrow's announcement or analysis of last weekend's Pro Tour. Consider a follow-up piece after the ban list drops to analyze the actual changes vs. speculation."

Note: I've consolidated the MTGRocks ban speculation articles into one entry since they cover the same topic. The "relevance" rankings prioritize news that is both recent and impactful: Pro Tour results (major competitive milestone) and impending Commander ban changes (affects the largest format). Arena updates and Standard metagame health are important but more process-oriented. The scout_notes provide context about the news cycle and suggest timing for follow-up coverage.
