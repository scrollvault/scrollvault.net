I'll publish this fact-checked blog post following the ScrollVault Publisher workflow. Let me start by validating and processing.

**Step 1: VALIDATE** - All required fields present, kebab-case matches, category is News, h2 tags present, author correct, date valid. ✓

**Step 2: BACKUP** - Creating backup of posts file
**Step 3: READ** - Reading current posts file
**Step 4: CHECK for duplicates**

I found a duplicate! A post with id `divination-in-action-how-we-scout-mtg-news` already exists in the posts file with the exact same title. This is a duplicate submission.

**OUTPUT: Duplicate post, not published**

The post cannot be published because it already exists in the database. The existing post was published on 2026-02-14 with the same title, slug, category, and content.

To update the post, you would need to either:
- Use a different ID/slug (e.g., `divination-in-action-how-we-scout-mtg-news-v2`)
- Or manually edit the existing post file directly

No changes were made to the posts file, and no build was triggered.
