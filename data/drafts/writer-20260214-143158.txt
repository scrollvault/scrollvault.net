  "body": "<h2>The Scout Pipeline: Your Automated News Hound</h2>\n<p>OpenClaw just fired up the Scout pipeline, and it's already combing the internet like a Goblin Guide with +1+1 counters. This thing runs every thirty minutes, hunting down the latest MTG news—set announcements, ban lists, tournament results, you name it. It's basically a massive Engineered Explosives for information: it sweeps away the chaff and keeps the good stuff. And the best part? It runs in the background while you're actually playing Magic. No more manually refreshing Wizards' website like you're trying to draw that one out-of-format card you need.</p>\n<div class=\"decklist-images\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.scryfall.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/9/4/94f0b51c-9d72-4887-9b93-70d9ae7c5b3b.jpg\" alt=\"Divination\" title=\"Divination\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.scryfall.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/3/5/35d36da9-80c5-4b5c-9c63-b0d3289b754a.jpg\" alt=\"Ponder\" title=\"Ponder\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.scryfall.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/4/44b8f40d-2b54-4e9c-b0a4-2579c4246a0a.jpg\" alt=\"Preordain\" title=\"Preordain\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.scryfall.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/2/524a8f37-5917-44f1-9aa7-31b592d2cc2b.jpg\" alt=\"Archmage Emeritus\" title=\"Archmage Emeritus\" loading=\"lazy\"></a>\n</div>\n<h2>Filtering the Noise: How We Find What Matters</h2>\n<p>Scouting isn't just about gathering everything—it's about knowing what to keep. Our pipeline uses a smart filter that looks for relevance, novelty, and impact. It's like having a Serum Visions that always shows you the cards you need. The Scout agent runs web searches, fetches articles, and then scores them based on how much our community will care. A new card spoiler? That's a 5. A minor rules clarification? Maybe a 2. We've tuned it so you get the headlines that actually affect your deckbuilding, not the fluff. The pipeline also checks source credibility—no rumors from sketchy forums make it through unless they're corroborated. That's the difference between top‑decking a win and bricking on a land.</p>\n\n<h2>What's in Today's Roundup?</h2>\n<p>Right now, the Scout is pulling in stories like the TMNT bundle delay announcement, the Companion app's new Player Profiles, and the full reveal of the Turtle Power! Commander deck. These are high‑relevance, high‑impact pieces that you'll want to know about before your next FNM. Imagine showing up to the shop and someone says, \"Did you hear the Companion app finally tracks your event history?\" You'll be the one who says \"Yeah, I read that on Scrollvault.\" That's the kind of edge we're giving you. The pipeline also grabs tournament results from the last 24 hours, so if a new Modern archetype is breaking the meta, you'll know about it before your opponent does.</p>\n\n<h2>Why This Beats Manually Refreshing Scryfall</h2>\n<p>Let's be real: checking news sites all day is a mana‑sink. It taps your attention and leaves you with less time to actually build decks or playtest. Our automated Scout is like casting a recurring Chancellor of the Annex—once it's in play, it saves you resources every turn. You get a curated feed of the most important stories without having to sift through ten different Reddit threads. That's more time to tune your sideboard against the new Jund pile, or to brew up a weird artifact combo that might actually work. And because the pipeline runs on a schedule, you can time your news consumption—no surprise updates when you're on the play and trying to focus.</p>\n\n<h2>Looking Ahead: Roundups at Dawn, Digests at Dusk</h2>\n<p>This pipeline is just the start. Our cron jobs are set to scout at 6 AM, assemble a digest at 8 AM, and post a recap at 6 PM. That means you'll get a fresh batch of news with your morning coffee, a deep‑dive over breakfast, and a wrap‑up before you head to the evening's tournament. It's continuous information flow that actually fits into a player's routine. Think of it as having a personal Journal‑keeper that only feeds you the cards you care about. The future? We might add custom alerts—so if a card you're watching gets banned or a new set spoilers drop, you get a ping instantly. That's the dream: never miss a beat, always have gas in hand.</p>",
