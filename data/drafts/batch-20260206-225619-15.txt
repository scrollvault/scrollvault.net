  "body": "<h2>The Sideboard is a Weapon, Not an Afterthought</h2><p>I cracked a pack the other day and a newer player asked me what the most important fifteen cards in my deck were. I didn't hesitate: \"My sideboard.\"</p><p>Blank stare.</p><p>Here's the brutal truth: you can curve out perfectly, have all the gas you need, but if you bring in the wrong fifteen cards post-board, you'll lose matches you should have won. Your sideboard doesn't just \"tweak\" your deck—it transforms it. It's the reason you beat the mirror. It's how you hate out your opponent's entire strategy.</p><p>Today we're building better sideboards, using a framework that actually works. I'm talking about cards like <strong>Rest in Peace</strong>, <strong>Mystical Dispute</strong>, <strong>Negate</strong>, <strong>Duress</strong>, and <strong>Unlicensed Hearse</strong>. These aren't just good cards—they're the backbone of a sideboard that wins.</p><h2>Rest in Peace: The Reset Button</h2><p>If you're playing white in Modern or Legacy and you don't have four <strong>Rest in Peace</strong> in your sideboard, you're doing it wrong.</p><p>This one-mana enchantment obliterates entire strategies. <strong>Rest in Peace</strong> exiles everything that dies or goes to the graveyard. No more value from lurking predators. No more recurring threats. No more delve or escape fuel.</p><p>Turn 1: <strong>Rest in Peace</strong> into a Thoughtseize-into-Duress hand? That's a 6-0 on the play against any graveyard deck. They can't operate. They can't kill you. They're playing vanilla creatures while you're deploying real threats.</p><p>The card is nuts because it doesn't just \"hate\" on graveyards—it annihilates them. It's proactive. It's cheap. Most importantly, it's a complete program that changes how your opponent plays the game. They have to find an answer before they can even start.</p><h2>Mystical Dispute: The Counter That Counters Everything</h2><p>Blue-based control mirrors used to be coin flips. Then <strong>Mystical Dispute</strong> happened.</p><p>Three mana, instant speed, counter any spell that's not a creature. But the real kicker: if you're countering a blue spell, it costs {U}{U} instead of {2}{U}{U}. That's the difference between \"I can't cast this\" and \"I just countered your Teferi's Protection.\"</p><p>In a world of Chord of Calling, Collected Company, and all the green four-mana do-everything creatures? <strong>Mystical Dispute</strong> is your answer. In a control mirror where somebody's going to resolve a planeswalker? This is the card that says \"nope.\"</p><p>I see too many sideboards running three <strong>Negate</strong> and one <strong>Mystical Dispute</strong>. That's backwards. You want four <strong>Mystical Dispute</strong> and three <strong>Negate</strong>. The discount clause is that good.</p><h2>Negate and Duress: The Duo That Never Sleeps</h2><p>These two are the bread and butter of any control or midrange sideboard. <strong>Negate</strong> handles non-creature spells. <strong>Duress</strong> handles everything else—well, everything in the hand anyway.</p><p>You're not bringing these in against aggro. You're bringing them in against combo, control, and any deck that relies on key pieces resolving. Turn 2 Duress their Serum Visions? That's information and tempo. Turn 3 Negate theirAdNauseam? That's a game win.</p><p>The key is that they're cheap. Two mana for either effect is highway robbery. You can curve these out with your other spells and actually develop your board while disrupting theirs.</p><p>I've seen people cut these in the face of creature-based decks. That's wrong. You need them for the non-creature-based decks that will otherwise run you over. The metagame isn't just go-wide aggro—it's also ramp players casting Storm the Festival and combo decks trying to assemble their pieces.</p><h2>Unlicensed Hearse: The Card Advantage Engine</h2><p>If you're in black and you're not playing <strong>Unlicensed Hearse</strong>, explain yourself.</p><p>Two mana, artifact, you can tap it to exile a card from any graveyard—and you get a +1/+1 counter. That's not just hate; that's a threat that grows while it disrupts.</p><p>Turn 1 <strong>Unlicensed Hearse</strong> into fetch land? You've already got a 2/2. Turn 2, exile their Elvish Reclaimer. Turn 3, it's a 3/3. By turn 5, it's a 5/5 that's been eating their graveyard all game.</p><p>The card is especially brutal in grindy matchups where you need a clock. It's a creature that dodges most removal (it's an artifact until it's turned on), it's card advantage (you're stripping their resources), and it's a win condition. I'm not sold on these \"graveyard hate\" creatures that don't actually impact the board—<strong>Unlicensed Hearse</strong> does it all.</p><h2>Building the Complete 15</h2><p>So how do you actually construct your fifteen sideboard cards?</p><p>First, identify the five decks you actually can't beat with your maindeck. That's your starting point. If you keep losing to Burn, bring in your lifegain and damage prevention. If you lose to Tron, bring in the land destruction. If you lose to combo, bring in the instant-speed disruption.</p><p>Second, play to your deck's strengths. If you're a control deck, bring in more counters and removal. If you're an aggro deck, bring in hate cards that don't slow you down. If you're a midrange deck, bring in cards that grind better than your opponent.</p><p>Third, don't just bring in cards willy-nilly—test them. Track your matchups. Which sideboard cards actually change the outcome? Which ones sit in your hand dead? If a card is dead more than 20% of the time, cut it.</p><p>My rule of thumb: 4 cards that hose the field's best deck, 4 cards that help your worst matchup, 3 cards that improve your mirror, and 4 flex slots based on the metagame you expect.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Your sideboard should feel as deliberate as your maindeck. It's not a collection of \"maybe good\" cards—it's your surgical kit.</p><p><strong>Rest in Peace</strong> for graveyard decks. <strong>Mystical Dispute</strong> for blue spells. <strong>Negate</strong> for anything else non-creature. <strong>Duress</strong> for stripping their hand. <strong>Unlicensed Hearse</strong> for a threat that also disrupts.</p><p>Build with purpose. Sideboard to win. The difference between 3-2 and 4-1 at your next FNM might just be those fifteen cards you brought in from the side.</p>",
