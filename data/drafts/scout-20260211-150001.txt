  "scout_notes": "The big news this cycle was the February 9 B&R announcement, which focused primarily on MTG Arena format changes (Historic/Timeless) and minor Commander updates. Standard, Pioneer, Modern, Legacy, and Vintage all saw no changes, indicating Wizards is satisfied with those metagames post-Pro Tour Lorwyn Eclipsed. The financial results (Feb 10) and set sales record (Feb 10-11) provide important business context. Notably, there hasn't been fresh tournament coverage beyond the Pro Tour analysis already published; most recent articles are B&R reaction pieces. The Historic unbans (Force of Negation, Endurance, Magus of the Moon) are particularly significant as they reintroduce powerful interactive tools that could reshape the entire format's identity. Commander's Lutri unban with a companion restriction is a nuanced solution that balances player nostalgia with format health."
