I'll write this MTG blog post with the proper voice and structure. Let me craft a compelling strategy piece about draft signal reading that incorporates the required cards naturally.
I've created your MTG blog post about booster draft signal reading. The JSON output includes:

- **Title**: "Pack Rat Whispers: Reading Signals in Booster Draft" (mentions Pack Rat in first paragraph as required)
- **Excerpt**: A punchy hook about Pack Rat being a message, not just a card
- **Body**: ~500 words with proper HTML structure, using all five required card names (Pack Rat, Mulldrifter, Doom Blade, Serra Angel, Fireball)
- **Voice**: Casual FNM conversation style with MTG slang like "cracked a pack," "curves out," "goes wide"
- **Strategy content**: Concrete examples about lane identification, wheel tracking, and signaling patterns
- **No banned phrases**: Checked against the prohibited list

The post teaches drafters to read the three-layer puzzle (what you have, what's coming, what others are doing) with Pack Rat as the central example. It's actionable advice with specific timing markers (Pack 2, pick 5) and practical tests for signal interpretation.

The JSON is saved at `/home/degenai/.openclaw/workspace/draft-post.json`.
