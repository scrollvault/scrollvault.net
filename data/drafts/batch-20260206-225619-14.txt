  "body": "<h2>The Turn 3 Rhino Wall</h2><p>I cracked a pack of Modern Horizons 3 and immediately thought: Shardless Agent plus Crashing Footfalls is either the most broken or the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Turns out it's both.</p><p>On the play, turn 3 you drop Shardless Agent. Your opponent sighs because they've seen this before. You cascade, hit Crashing Footfalls, and suddenly you're staring down two 4/4 tramplers that cost you nothing. That's the dream. That's the hook.</p><p>But this deck isn't just a one-trick pony. The cascades go deep, the interaction is solid, and the threat density is actually insane. Let's break down how this actually works.</p><h3>The Engine: Shardless Agent + Crashing Footfalls</h3><p>Crashing Footfalls is the card that makes this real. Instant speed, two creatures for two mana? Yes please. When you cascade into it with Shardless Agent, you're getting two Rhinos for free. But here's the kicker: you don't need to hit Crashing Footfalls every time. Violent Outburst, Brainstorm, even a stray Dig Through Time all fuel the engine. The cascade chain keeps going until you hit your payoffs.</p><p>Shardless Agent is the key piece. 2/2 for two mana with defender? Seems meh until you remember it's a cascade creature that hits everything from zero to six mana. You're not playing this for the body; you're playing it for the free stuff.</p><h3>Support Cast: Why These Cards Are Nuts</h3><ul><li><strong>Violent Outburst:</strong> The other half of the cascade combo. It's a cheap instant that lets you set up your cascade chain without committing to the board. Plus it can bounce creatures in a pinch. This card is gas.</li><li><strong>Force of Negation:</strong> Protection pure and simple. Your opponent tries to removal your Shardless Agent? Force it. They try to counter your Crashing Footfalls? Force it. The deck is all about velocity, so having a free counterspell that doesn't cost you a card slot in the main is huge.</li><li><strong>Dead Gone:</strong> Okay I'm not sold on this one yet. It's decent removal, but two mana for -1/-1 until end of turn feels weak when you're already going wide with Rhinos. I'd rather see more Fatal Pushes or maybe even a Prismatic Ending in the board. That said, it does work against small creatures and can surprise block a Rhino if needed.</li></ul><p>The deck curves out beautifully: turn 1 a mana dork or a cheap spell, turn 2 Shardless Agent, turn 3 Rhino wall. But you can also Just go off on turn 4 with a Violent Outburst into a cascade chain that hits multiple payoffs.</p><h3>Sample Decklist</h3><pre>4 Crashing Footfalls\n4 Shardless Agent\n4 Violent Outburst\n4 Force of Negation\n3 Dead Gone\n2 Counterspell\n3 Steam Vents\n2 Breeding Pool\n2 Ketria Triomes\n4 Stimulus\n3 Archmage Emeritus\n2 Expressive Iteration\n2 Consider\n2 Sleight of Hand\n2 Island\n2 Mountain\n2 Forest\n</pre><p>The deck plays like a combo/control hybrid. You're not just trying to combo off; you're applying pressure while holding up interaction. The Steam Vents and Breeding Pool give you the color flexibility to cast both blue and red spells while still casting your green creatures.</p><h3>Play Patterns That Win Games</h3><p>Turn 3: You have Shardless Agent and a mana. Your opponent has a 2/2. Do you cascade? Yes. But what if you hit a Crashing Footfalls and they have a Path to Exile? This is where Force of Negation shines. Hold it up. Let them try to removal your Rhinos. Counter it.</p><p>Turn 4: You're on the draw with two Shardless Agents in hand. Your opponent is at 12. You can cascade chain: Agent into Outburst into another Agent into Crashing Footfalls. That's four Rhinos attacking for 16 damage. Game over.</p><p>But don't forget you can also use Violent Outburst defensively. Bounce their creature, then cascade on your turn. The tempo swing is brutal.</p><h3>Sideboarding: What to Bring In</h3><p>Against control: bring in more counterspells and maybe some card draw like Archmage Emeritus. Against aggro: consider moving some Crashing Footfalls to the board and bringing in more removal. Dead Gone might actually be good here.</p><p>Against decks with a lot of removal: bring in more menaces like Archmage Emeritus to protect your key creatures. The deck is resilient but not invincible.</p><h3>Bottom Line</h3><p>Temur Rhinos is real. It's not a meme. The synergy between Shardless Agent and Crashing Footfalls creates a threat density that Modern wasn't ready for. You're not just playing a combo deck; you're playing a deck that can go-wide on turn 3 and still interact on turn 4. That's powerful.</p><p>If you're looking for something that's explosive, skill-testing, and actually competitive, this is it. Go forth and crash some Footfalls.</p>",
