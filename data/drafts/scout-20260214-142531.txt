Pipeline test started successfully. Current status:

- Log shows: Step 1 (Scout) began at 14:25:31
- The Scout agent is now executing its web searches for latest MTG news
- Pipeline is running in the background; I'm monitoring continuously

I'll report back as soon as the pipeline completes or if any step fails. Estimated total runtime: 10–15 minutes.
