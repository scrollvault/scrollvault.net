I'll fact-check this post and produce a corrected JSON. The post contains significant inaccuracies: it presents speculative analysis of card abilities as fact, but all these cards are officially revealed with known text that differs substantially from the speculation.

**Verification Summary:**
- Source URL (Wizards announcement) verifies: deck name "Turtle Power!", release March 6, 2026, commanders listed, prerelease events starting Feb 27.
- All card names (Leonardo, Donatello, Splinter, Raphael, Michelangelo, Heroes in a Half Shell) are confirmed real on Scryfall.
- Actual card abilities are completely different from post's descriptions. Post incorrectly speculated about abilities instead of reporting known facts.
- Post must be revised to present accurate card text or omit detailed ability descriptions.
