I'll run the QA test suite on the live site. Let me start by checking the posts data and then systematically run all tests.
Now I'll run the comprehensive QA test suite. Let me create a script to execute all tests systematically.
The script encountered an issue. Let me run the tests step by step manually to ensure reliability. I'll start by extracting the 5 newest post slugs directly:
Perfect. Now let me run each test systematically and compile the report.

**1. CRITICAL PAGES TEST:**
**2. POST PAGES TEST (5 newest):**
**3. SEO VALIDATION (homepage + first post):**
**4. SITEMAP VALIDATION:**
**5. CONTENT STRUCTURE (homepage):**
**6. LINK INTEGRITY (homepage internal links):**
**7. SECURITY HEADERS:**
**8. PERFORMANCE SPOT-CHECK:**
Now I'll compile the complete QA report:

[CRITICAL ISSUES]
✗ SEO tags missing on homepage and posts
  - No canonical URLs
  - No og:url
  - No structured data (JSON-LD)
  - Homepage og:type is "article" instead of "website"
  Impact: Poor SEO, missing Open Graph integration, reduced social sharing.

✗ Security headers missing
  - No HSTS header
  - No X-Content-Type-Options
  - No X-Frame-Options
  - No CSP
  Impact: Potential security vulnerabilities, missing HTTPS enforcement.

[RECOMMENDATIONS]
1. Add canonical tags to all pages (points to self or preferred URL)
2. Add og:url meta tag matching page URL
3. Implement JSON-LD structured data (Article for posts, WebSite for homepage)
4. Fix homepage og:type to "website"
5. Configure web server to include security headers:
   - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN
   - Content-Security-Policy: appropriate policy

All other checks passed successfully. Site is functional and fast, but SEO and security hardening needed before production launch.
```

That's the full QA report. The site is live and functional, but needs SEO tags and security headers added to meet quality standards.
