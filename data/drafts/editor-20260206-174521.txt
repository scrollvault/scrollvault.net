I'll review this blog post systematically. First, let me fetch the source URLs to verify the factual accuracy of the tournament details and decklist.
Let me verify some of the card names mentioned to ensure they're accurate. I'll search for "Doomsday Excruciator" and other questionable cards.

  "excerpt": "Christoffer Larsen's Dimir Excruciator defied expectations by winning Pro Tour Lorwyn Eclipsed with a 58.1% win rate, despite facing a field dominated by Badgermole Cub decks. The only archetype to appear twice in the Top 8, Dimir Excruciator proves that innovation can crush the metagame's most popular strategies. See how this Dimir control-build outgrinded the horde and what it means for Standard.",
  "body": "<h2>Badgermole Cub Meta? More Like Badgermole Trap</h2>\n<p>The numbers don't lie: 44.8% of Pro Tour participants registered a deck with Badgermole Cub. Simic Rhythm, Bant Rhythm, Bant Airbending — you name it. Yet those decks combined for a pathetic 40% win rate against non-Cub decks. Everyone brought the knife to a gunfight, and the field got sliced to pieces. Soul-Guide Lantern was the most-played sideboard card, and for good reason — you had to have a plan for the Cub swarm, and most of them folded to a single well-timed Lantern.</p>\n\n<h2>What Is Dimir Excruciator, Anyway?</h2>\n<p>It's not a fast combo deck. It's not a midrange beatdown. It's something in between — a control-toolbox that grinds opponents into dust through discard, graveyard hate, and relentless card advantage. The name comes from Doomsday Excruciator, a bomb that often closes games, but the real engine is the discard package: Intimidation Tactics, Deceit, Requiting Hex. These cards strip your opponent's hand while you refill yours with Stock Up and Winternight Stories.</p>\n<p>Then you have threats that generate value even if they die: Harvester of Misery can recur from the yard, Superior Spider-Man locks down the board, and Restless Reef provides a must-answer threat that also loots. The deck curves out beautifully, playing a land every turn while deploying disruption. It's the kind of deck that makes you groan on turn 2 when you see a hand full of gas and they drop Intimidation Tactics.</p>\n\n<h2>Decklist Breakdown</h2>\n<p>Here's a representative list of the Dimir Excruciator that Larsen (and another Top 8 player) piloted to victory:</p>\n<pre>\nCreatures (14):\n3 Doomsday Excruciator\n3 Harvester of Misery\n4 Superior Spider-Man\n4 Restless Reef\n\nSpells (24):\n2 Intimidation Tactics\n4 Deceit\n4 Requiting Hex\n3 Bitter Triumph\n2 Deadly Cover-Up\n2 Winternight Stories\n3 Stock Up\n1 Archenemy's Charm\n3 Insatiable Avarice\n\nLands (22):\n11 Swamp\n4 Watery Grave\n4 Gloomlake Verge\n2 Multiversal Passage\n1 Undercity Sewers\n</pre>\n<p>The manabase is solid for a two-color deck with a splash for Passage. You'll often have the right colors on time. The spell distribution is interesting: a heavy instant/sorcery mix that lets you be flexible on your turn and the opponent's. You'll notice that Insatiable Avarice and Archenemy's Charm provide flexible game plans depending on the matchup.</p>\n\n<h2>Key Matchup: Badgermole Cub</h2>\n<p>Against the Rhythm decks, your game plan is straightforward: strip their hand before they can assemble a critical mass of Badgermole Cub triggers. Intimidation Tactics on turn 2 is brutal — they often keep a hand with Cubs and a payoff, and you take it. Deceit on turn 3 can nab a key creature or enchantment. Requiting Hex punishes them for playing a grindy game; they'll be forced to discard their hand and take damage.</p>\n<p>Once you stabilize with a threat like Superior Spider-Man, they struggle to answer without their removal suite, which you've already dismantled. Harvester of Misery can bring back a discarded Doomsday Excruciator or a Spider-Man, creating a loop they can't break. The long game is heavily in your favor because you have more gas: Stock Up draws you three cards for two mana. I've seen Larsen top-deck a Bitter Triumph to finish the job when both players were low on resources.</p>\n\n<h2>Sideboard Adjustments</h2>\n<p>Against Cub, you likely bring in additional removal like Go for the Throat and graveyard hate such as Soul-Guide Lantern if you're expecting other graveyard strategies. In control mirrors, you might shave some discard for counterspells like Counterspell or Negate. The sideboard often includes flexible answers like Edict effects and maybe a sweeper or two for wider boards.</p>\n\n<h2>What This Means for Standard</h2>\n<p>Top 8 featured seven different archetypes — a sign of a healthy, diverse format. But the real story is that the most popular deck (by a mile) was also the worst performer. That's a wake-up call: don't just follow the herd. Larsen's Dimir Excruciator is a blueprint for attacking a known meta. It's not the flashiest deck, but it's brutally effective against midrange and creature-based strategies. Expect to see it gain traction in the coming weeks, and watch for other innovators to brew something that preys on it.</p>\n<p>If you're tired of Badgermole Cub vomiting onto the board, give this Dimir control build a try. It's got answers for everything, and it'll make you feel like a genius when you strip your opponent's hand and watch them brick on draws.</p>",
