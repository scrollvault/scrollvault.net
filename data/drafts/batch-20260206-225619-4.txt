  "body": "<p>The new Liliana planeswalker leak just hit, and I'm already terrified. This isn't just another black walker - it's the card that will define Standard and Pioneer for the next two years. She combines the best parts of Liliana of the Veil with abilities that directly enable the most oppressive decks in the format.</p>\n\n<h2>The Perfect Storm of Abilities</h2>\n\n<p>Start with the real kicker: her +1 ability exiles up to one target card from a graveyard. That's already relevant against Sheoldred decks, against reanimator, against any graveyard strategy. Then it says: 'You may discard a card. If you do, draw a card.' That's Dark Confidant in loyalty ability form. And to top it off, 'Each opponent discards a card.' On the play, turn 2 you Thoughtseize them, turn 3 you +1 this, discard a land to draw, and they discard another card. That's not fair.</p>\n\n<p>The -3 creates two 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens. Not the most exciting, but it fills the board, provides bodies for Aristocrats strategies, and can pressure planeswalkers. Solid rate and ensures she's not a brick when you need blockers.</p>\n\n<p>Then the -7: choose an opponent. Exile all cards from their graveyard. You may cast a creature or sorcery card from among those exiled cards without paying its mana cost. That's a one-way reanimation spell. On the play, turn 4 you slam this (with a Fatal Push backup), turn 5 you -7 and steal their Sheoldred. Game over.</p>\n\n<h2>Synergy with the Deck We All Play</h2>\n\n<p>The synergy with existing cards is what makes this truly broken. In a Standard full of Thoughtseize, Fatal Push, and Sheoldred the Apocalypse, this Liliana becomes the linchpin. Dark Confidant already rewards you for discarding - now you have a planeswalker that makes them discard and draws you cards. That's insane. The -7 directly fuels into Sheoldred's ability, letting you cheat the big creature into play while your opponent stares at an empty graveyard.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the Standard shell: 4 Thoughtseize, 4 Fatal Push, 4 Dark Confidant, 4 Sheoldred the Apocalypse, and 4 of this new Liliana. That's not a deck - that's a statement. You curve out with Thoughtseize on turn 1, Liliana on turn 3 with a Fatal Push backup, and by turn 5 you're dropping Sheoldred for free off her ultimate. Your opponent is top-decking while you have a 6/6 deathtouch flyer and two Zombie tokens.</p>\n\n<h2>Pioneer Is Even Worse</h2>\n\n<p>Standard is bad enough, but Pioneer is a nightmare. Pioneer enables even more powerful graveyard strategies. Cards like Grisly Salvage, Cathartic Reunion, and even more efficient enablers mean this Liliana's abilities are even more potent. The -7 might as well say 'win the game' against many Pioneer decks that rely on their graveyard as a resource.</p>\n\n<p>Control decks would play her as a one-card win condition. Midrange decks would use her as their engine. Even Aristocrats decks gain from the discard and token generation. It's a four-of in every black deck that cares about its graveyard - which is all of them.</p>\n\n<h2>Is This Too Good?</h2>\n\n<p>I'm not sold on the -7 being too strong in a vacuum - reanimation spells exist already - but having it on a planeswalker that already gains you value with her +1 is what breaks it. You can use her loyalty ability multiple times before you ultimate, so she's not a one-trick pony. She's a threat that demands an answer immediately, and if they don't have it, you just win.</p>\n\n<p>The real question: how does this not break everything? The answer is, it probably does. I expect Wizards to reprint this at a higher mana cost or with restrictions, but if it drops as is? Standard and Pioneer are about to get a whole lot more oppressive. My wallet is ready - are yours?</p>",
