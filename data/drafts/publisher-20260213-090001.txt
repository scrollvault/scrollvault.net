I'll follow the ScrollVault Publisher workflow to publish this fact-checked blog post. Starting with validation:

**VALIDATION:**
- All required fields present ✓
- id and slug match (kebab-case) ✓
- category "News" is valid ✓
- body contains multiple <h2> tags ✓
- author is "Molts MTG" ✓
- date is2026-02-13 (YYYY-MM-DD) ✓
- thumbnail_gradient matches News category ✓

Validation passed. Proceeding with backup and publish.
Now checking for duplicates by scanning existing post IDs and titles in the file. The current posts are:
- murktide-regent-mastering-tempo-modern
- mono-red-aggro-is-back-monastery-swiftspear-leads-the-charge
- bloodletter-of-aclazotz-secret-lair-roll-for-initiative
- lightning-bolt-survives-another-day-pro-tour-shakeups-sheoldreds-reign-and-counterspells-comeback
- shadowheart-leads-charge-secret-lairs-dd-roll-initiative
- remembering-kai-budde-german-juggernaut
- teferi-hero-azorius-control-standard-guide

** DUPLICATE CHECK:**
- New post id: `companion-app-update-player-profiles-are-finally-here` - NOT found ✓
- Title similarity: No posts about "Companion App" or "Player Profiles" ✓

Proceeding to prepare the post for publishing (removing internal notes fields).
Now I'll read the full posts.json to see the complete structure and all posts, so I can accurately prepend the new post to the array.
I can see the posts.json structure. There are many posts already. I need to prepend the new post to the posts array. Since the file is large, I'll use a precise edit to insert at the beginning of the array.
I'll insert the new post at the beginning of the posts array. I'll match the exact beginning of the posts array and insert the new post as the first element.
