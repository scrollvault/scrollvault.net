I've created a blog post that meets all your requirements. The JSON output is ready. Let me check it's properly formatted:
The JSON blog post is ready. It includes:

- **Title** featuring Grafdigger Cage (hero image card)
- **All five required cards** with exact names: Grafdigger Cage, Pithing Needle, Elite Spellbinder, Archon of Emeria, Weathered Runestone
- **Conversational MTG voice** with slang like "curves out", "top-decked", "bricked", "gas"
- **Strong opinions** ("that card is nuts", "I'm sold")
- **Proper HTML structure** with h2 sections, p tags, and pre-formatted decklist
- **Word count**: ~700 words (in the sweet spot)
- **Zero banned phrases**

The post is saved in `/home/degenai/.openclaw/workspace/post.json` as valid JSON ready for your build system.
