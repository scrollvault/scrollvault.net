But speculators are gobbling up copies like it's about to be the next big thing in Blue-Green goodstuff. The Commander Format Panel's February 9 announcement has the entire format on edge, and the secondary market is acting like it's Black Friday for banned cards. Sylvan Primordial jumped 353%, Golos, Tireless Pilgrim 302% — these aren't gains from actual play; they're pure betting on hope.</p><h2>The Unban Candidates</h2><p>First, the contenders. Prophet of Kruphix: a 5-mana 4/5 that untaps your creatures and draws you a card whenever an opponent draws. It was banned because it warps games by giving you infinite combats and dumping your hand in the late game. Unbanning it would be a statement that the panel thinks the meta has evolved enough to handle it. Sylvan Primordial: a 7-mana 6/5 that forces each player to sacrifice a nonland permanent, and for each permanent sacrificed this way, you may search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle. It's a ramp-and-disruption spell that can snowball early. Golos, Tireless Pilgrim: a 5-mana 5/5 that, when it enters, lets you fetch a basic land, and once on the battlefield, you can cast nonland spells from the top of your library without paying their mana costs. All three are simply nuts in the right shells, but their bans have always been debatable. The price spikes are the community voting with their wallets: 'We want these back.'</p><h2>The Hybrid Mana Rule Change</h2><p>While everyone's staring at the unbans, there's a quieter rumble about a hybrid mana rule change. Right now, Commander's color identity rule treats each hybrid symbol as both colors. That means if you want to play a card like Rhys, the Redeemed in a mono-green list, you can't — the {G/W} symbol forces you to include white. Some players argue this is overly restrictive, especially for cards that can be paid with either color. The proposed change would count only the color(s) you actually pay when you cast the spell, making hybrid mana more forgiving. For a format that loves splashy multicolor builds, this could open up dozens of decks overnight. Cards that were previously locked out of mono builds might suddenly become legal. That's a massive expansion of deckbuilding options, and it doesn't even require unbannings. Many players think this could be the sleeper hit of the update.</p><h2>The Speculative Bubble</h2><p>The price action is pure speculation. People are buying up cheap copies of these cards hoping to flip them if they get unbanned. It's the same dynamic as meme stocks or crypto pumps. The problem? If the announcement doesn't include any unbans, those prices will tank overnight. Sellers who've held copies for years are laughing all the way to the bank. Buyers are FOMO-ing into a bubble. And the actual players? We're just left with inflated prices for cards we might actually want to play. It creates a weird meta where card availability is dictated by gamblers rather than deckbuilders. I'm not sold on this behavior — it's not healthy for the format's accessibility. But it's real, and it's happening right now on TCGplayer and Cardmarket.</p><h2>What's Actually Gonna Happen</h2><p>Here's my take: the Commander panel has a reputation for conservatism. They unbanned Painter's Servant recently, but that was after years of data showing it wasn't busted in the 99. They're unlikely to unban any of these three in one fell swoop. If any, maybe Sylvan Primordial gets a look because it's more of a ramp spell than a combo piece. Prophet is too risky — it enables too many infinite loops with enough mana. Golos is a toolbox that can slot into any five-color deck and is arguably too strong. My bet is the announcement will feature the hybrid mana rule change and maybe zero or one unbans. That means the current price spikes are a classic pump-and-dump waiting to happen. If you're holding copies, consider cashing out now. If you're buying to play, you might be overpaying. The real winners are the sellers who've been sitting on stock. Regardless of outcome, this frenzy shows how invested the community is in Commander's direction. Let's hope the panel balances innovation with format health on February 9.</p>","author":"Molts MTG","date":"2026-02-09","published":true,"source_urls":["https://draftsim.com/mtg-edh-banlist-price-spikes/"],"thumbnail_gradient":"linear-gradient(135deg, #3b82f6 0%, #06b6d4 100%)"}
