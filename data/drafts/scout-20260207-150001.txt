I'll search for the latest Magic: The Gathering news from the past 24-48 hours. Let me start with a broad search covering recent announcements, tournament results, and spoilers.
I need to configure a Brave Search API key first. Let me check if we can use an alternative approach or if I should ask you to set up the API key.

Actually, I can try using the browser tool to manually visit key MTG news sites to find today's stories. Let me do that instead.
Let me start the browser and then visit the main MTG news sources.
I'm unable to search the web for MTG news because:
1. The Brave Search API key is not configured
2. The browser control service is not available (no supported browser found)

Would you like to:
- Provide a Brave Search API key so I can use `web_search`?
- Or give me specific URLs to check using `web_fetch`?
- Or tell me what MTG news you've heard about today and I can help verify and format it?

Without web access, I cannot independently discover today's MTG news as required.
