  "body": "<p>You're at the final table, your opponent across the table looks confident, and you're staring at a 6-card hand that has everything except that second land. Serum Visions is glinting in your hand alongside a Thoughtseize and a Noble Hierarch. Do you ship it to five? Or do you keep, hoping the London scry finds you that second Forest?</p>\n\n<p>This is the modern mulligan dilemma. The London Mulligan rule changed everything. When you take a mulligan, you scry 1 after drawing your new hand. That tiny bit of selection turns what used to be a penalty into a tactical tool. Now, keeping a 6-card hand isn't just about \"good enough\" — it's about \"can I leverage that scry to get where I need to be?\"</p>\n\n<h2>The New Keep Metrics</h2>\n\n<p>Forget the old \"7-card hand with 2-3 lands\" rule. In London, your 6-card hand gets a quality filter. That means hands that were marginal keepers before are now often correct keeps. But not all sketchy sixes are created equal.</p>\n\n<p>Ask yourself four questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Can I cast my spells on curve?</strong> If you need two lands to play your key cards, a 6-card hand better have two mana sources.</li>\n<li><strong>Do I have a proactive plan?</strong> Are you the aggressor or the control? Aggro/combo decks need to curve out; control can afford to durdle a bit.</li>\n<li><strong>Is my hand synergistic?</strong> A Noble Hierarch without a high-mana payoff is just a 0/1 that eats a Bolt.</li>\n<li><strong>What does my scry target look like?</strong> If your deck has high land density and your hand is missing one specific piece, keep and scry for it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Serum Visions: The Literal Scryenomenon</h3>\n\n<p>Hands with Serum Visions are keep magnets for good reason. That card draws you two and scrys two. In a 6-card hand, Serum Visions is half your selection package. It can smooth out a shaky mana base, find your missing threat, or dig past a brick.</p>\n\n<p>Keep a 6 if you have: 1 land + Serum Visions + any other spell that's okay on one mana. The plan is: play land, cast Visions, see two cards, put one on bottom, draw a fresh one. That's card advantage and selection. You just went from 6 cards to effectively 8 quality cards.</p>\n\n<p><em>Serum Visions</em> in a 6-card hand is often correct even if the rest of the hand is mediocre because the card fixes so much. It's not just a cantrip — it's a London enabler.</p>\n\n<h3>Thoughtseize: The Interactive Keep</h3>\n\n<p>Thoughtseize changes ownership of the game. If you keep a 6-card hand with Thoughtseize, you'd better have a way to cast it on turn 1 (or turn 2 on the play without disruption). And you'd better have a follow-up play.</p>\n\n<p>The trap: keeping a hand with Thoughtseize, two lands, and four other spells that all cost 3+ mana. You'll strip their best card on turn 1, but then you'll have nothing to play on turn 2. That's a losing play against most decks.</p>\n\n<p>The keep: Thoughtseize, a one-drop creature (like Ragavan Nimble Pilferer), and two lands. You take their removal, play Ragavan on turn 1, and steal their best non-land. That's a 2-for-1 and tempo swing. Now you're dictating the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Noble Hierarch and Birds of Paradise: Acceleration Dilemma</h3>\n\n<p>These mana dorks are the backbone of many Modern and Legacy decks. But a hand with Noble Hierarch and three three-drops isn't automatically a keep in a 6-card hand. You need to ask: can I actually use the acceleration?</p>\n\n<p>Keep if you have: Noble Hierarch + a 2-drop + a 3-drop. Turn 1 Hierarch, turn 2 your 2-drop, turn 3 your 3-drop. That's a perfect curve. That hand is gas.</p>\n\n<p>Ship if you have: Noble Hierarch but your highest CMC is 3, and the rest are one-drops. You're not gaining much from the acceleration; you're just playing a 1/1 on turn 1. That's not worth the risk of not having enough mana to cast everything.</p>\n\n<p>Birds of Paradise is even more punishing because it taps for any color. Keep with it if you have a high-mana payoff (like a 4-drop or a two-color spell). Otherwise, you're just playing a flying chump blocker.</p>\n\n<h3>Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer: The Dash King</h3>\n\n<p>Ragavan Nimble Pilferer is format-warping. A turn 1 Ragavan often wins the game on its own. But in a 6-card hand, you have to consider the dash clause.</p>\n\n<p>If your hand is just Ragavan and five other spells that cost 2+? Keep. You dash Ragavan on turn 1 for R, leaving you with a 5-card hand but an extra mana. That's fine. On turn 2 you can use Ragavan's ability to cast spells from the top of your library. You're still accessing those five cards, just with a timing delay.</p>\n\n<p>The exception: if you have zero other one-drops and your deck relies on curving out perfectly, maybe ship. But Ragavan is so absurd that he often deserves the keep even on the draw.</p>\n\n<h2>Archetype Matters</h2>\n\n<p>Combo decks: You need the pieces. A 6-card hand with the two key combo cards and a tutor is a keep even if you're missing a third land. You'll scry for it.</p>\n\n<p>Control decks: You want 3+ lands and a sweeper. A 6-card hand with 2 lands, a Counterspell, and a Sphinx's Revelation? Probably ship. But 3 lands, a draw spell, and a removal? That's fine.</p>\n\n<p>Midrange decks: You want threat density. A hand with three creatures (Noble Hierarch, Ragavan, something else) is keepable. You'll draw into your midrange haymakers.</p>\n\n<h2>Your Mulligan Checklist</h2>\n\n<p>Before you ship to five, run this mental script:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do I have at least two mana sources?</strong> (Three if you're playing a deck that wants to cast 3-drops on turn 2)</li>\n<li><strong>Do I have a one-drop threat? </strong> (Ragavan, Goyf, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Do I have a two-mana play? </strong> (Thoughtseize, Spell Pierce, a 2-drop creature)</li>\n<li><strong>Is my hand cohesive? </strong> (Discard + creatures, ramp + payoff, draw spells + threats)</li>\n<li><strong>If I keep, will my scry actually help? </strong> (If you're missing a specific card, scrying for it is good. If you're just missing lands in general, scrying won't fix it.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you answered \"yes\" to three or more, keep. If not, ship.</p>\n\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\n\n<p>London Mulligan turned mulligans from a tax into a tool. That 6-card hand with Serum Visions? It might just be the right keep. Thoughtseize in hand? That's interactive magic. Ragavan? Dash him out and feel good about it.</p>\n\n<p>But remember: your deck's plan matters more than any single rule. Playtest. Watch matches. Develop a feel for what your 6-card hands actually do. And next time you're agonizing at the table, just remember: you get a scry. Use it.</p>\n\n<p>What's your sketchiest 6-card keep?
