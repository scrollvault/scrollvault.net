  "body": "<h2>Finally, It's Happening</h2>\n<p>Pioneer on MTG Arena is no longer a meme. After years of speculating, Wizards officially announced Pioneer Masters - a curated set bringing the format's most iconic cards to digital. And they didn't hold back. Nykthos Shrine to Nyx is coming. Collected Company is coming. This isn't just a half-measure; this is the whole damn thing.</p>\n\n<h2>The Reprint Run is Insane</h2>\n<p>Let's talk about the actual card list. Nykthos Shrine to Nyx is the headline act for a reason. That card has been a format-defining pillar in Modern for years and basically enables entire archetypes on its own. Enchantment-based devotion decks just got a whole new lease on life. What's crazy is that Collected Company is also in this set. That's two format staples that have been Modern-only forever, now available on Arena. The card quality doesn't stop there either - Eidolon of the Great Revel is here to keep the burn decks honest, Monastery Mentor continues to terrorize creature-based strategies, and Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet brings the graveyard hate that's always relevant.</p>\n\n<h2>What This Means for the Format</h2>\n<p>I'm not going to pretend like I know the exact meta yet, but we can make some educated guesses. Nykthos in a shell with Starfield of Nyx and other enchantments is already proven in Modern. Expect that deck to be Tier 1 on day one. Collected Company goes wide Zooag ngaagg Rev2.0 will be a thing, and it's going to be oppressive. The card is straight gas in any creature-based deck with a low curve. You're looking at Elves, Humans, and probably some new weird concoction nobody's thought of yet.</p>\n\n<p>Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet is interesting. It's not as flexible as Rest in Peace, but it's a creature that actually attacks. Against graveyard strategies, this card is brutal. Turn 3 Kalitas against a reanimator deck is basically game over. It also happens to be absurd against Arclight Phoenix and those sorts of shenanigans. The exile clause is no joke.</p>\n\n<h2>The Card That Has Me Unsure</h2>\n<p>Eidolon of the Great Revel is a powerful card, don't get me wrong. But in a format with Force of Virtue and other powerful creature-based removal, I'm not sold on how good it actually is. Yes, it punishes decks that can't deal with it quickly, but Pioneer has enough tools to deal with a 2/2 for 2 that doesn't immediately impact the board. Maybe I'm wrong and it just slots into Burn and becomes insane. We'll see.</p>\n\n<h2>Deckbuilding Implications</h2>\n<p>Real talk: this set is going to accelerate Pioneer's power level dramatically. The decks that were already tier 1 just got new toys. Decks that were struggling might suddenly have a shot. I'm thinking specifically about Enchantress shells - Nykthos is the missing piece they needed to compete. With Starfield, Journey to Nowhere, and now Nykthos, that deck can generate absurd value and稳定 mana. That's dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Collected Company in Elves is scary too. The deck already has absurd mana acceleration and card advantage. Adding CoCo means you can go from zero to six power on turn 4 consistently. That's not fair. Humans gets a similar boost with CoCo, though they already had such a strong core that it might not be as format-warping.</p>\n\n<h2>What's Missing?</h2>\n<p>As excited as I am, there are some notable omissions. No Fetchlands means mana bases will still be relatively tame compared to Modern. That's probably for the best - Pioneer is supposed to be a step below Modern in power level. But without fetches, some three-color decks might struggle to support Nykthos reliably. We'll have to see how the mana base shake-up goes.</p>\n\n<p>Also worth noting: we don't have a full set list yet. Wizards said it's a \"curated\" set, which means they're picking and choosing cards rather than doing a full supplemental booster. That's great - it means they can avoid including format-warping degeneracy. But we'll have to wait for the complete list to really understand the implications.</p>\n\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Pioneer Masters is the biggest news in MTG Arena all year. This format has been a pipe dream for so long, and now it's actually materializing with a reprint run that includes Nykthos Shrine to Nyx and Collected Company. Those two cards alone change everything. The fact that they're bringing over Eidolon, Monastery Mentor, and Kalitas shows they're serious about making this a real format. Get your collections ready. Pioneer is coming, and it's bringing some serious heat.</p>",
