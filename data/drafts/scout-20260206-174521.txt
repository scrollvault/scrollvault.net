  "scout_notes": "Web access was limited due to JavaScript requirements and network blocking, preventing full scraping of Reddit, ChannelFireball, and some Wizards pages. Information gathered primarily from MTGGoldfish article feeds (Feb 6) and magic.gg news listings (Feb 1-6). No ban list changes detected in the past 48 hours beyond February's already-announced updates; no MTG Arena economy or patch notes surfaced. Secrets of Strixhaven (April 24 release) continues to be promoted but no new card spoilers found. The Pro Tour Lorwyn Eclipsed aftermath dominates current news cycle."
