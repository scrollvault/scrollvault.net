  "excerpt": "Tapping for 12 mana on turn 4? That's the Jeskai Lotus Combo dream. With Lotus Field, Thespian Stage, and Blood Sun, you'll generate infinite mana and close the game with Omniscience. Pore Over the Pages draws you the cards you need to go off.",
  "body": "<p>Turn 1: Plains. Turn 2: Lotus Field. That's it. That's the dream. You just cast a land that taps for three mana of any color after sacrificing three other lands, and you're already thinking about how you're going to untap it and go off. In Vintage, that dream is very much alive, and the Jeskai Lotus Combo deck is here to make it happen every single match.</p><h2>The Combo in a Nutshell</h2><p>The core is simple: Lotus Field enters the battlefield, you sacrifice three other lands (or use effects to sacrifice them), and you've got three mana. But you need to untap it. That's where the engine comes in—Thespian Stage copies Lotus Field, Blood Sun shuts down the legend rule for your nonbasic lands, and Pore Over the Pages digs to find your pieces while drawing cards. Once you have infinite mana, Omniscience lets you cast anything from your hand for free, and you finish with a massive X spell or a wide board of creatures.</p><h2>Key Cards That Make It Happen</h2><h3>Lotus Field</h3><p>The namesake card. A land that taps for three mana but requires sacrificing three lands. In Vintage, you have the mana fixing and sacrifice outlets to make this work. The beauty is that it's a land, so it dodges many removal spells, and once you have a Thespian Stage in play, you can have multiple copies generating insane mana. Lotus Field is the mana engine that powers the entire deck.</p><h3>Thespian Stage</h3><p>This is the copy machine. It enters as a copy of any land you control, including Lotus Field, and it's not legendary (well, it is legendary normally, but Blood Sun changes that). Actually, Thespian Stage is a legendary land, but with Blood Sun it becomes nonlegendary, so you can have multiple copies. More importantly, when it copies Lotus Field, it becomes another Lotus Field, effectively doubling your mana production. You can also copy it again to build a huge army of Lotus Fields. This card is nuts because it turns one Lotus Field into many.</p><h3>Blood Sun</h3><p>Here's the glue that holds it together. Blood Sun is a 2-mana enchantment that says \"Nonbasic lands you control aren't legendary.\" This means your Thespian Stages (which are normally legendary) won't kill each other. You can have as many Thespian Stages as you want, each copying Lotus Field. Without Blood Sun, you'd be stuck with one Thespian Stage at most. This card is essential to go wide with your mana sources.</p><h3>Pore Over the Pages</h3><p>This is your card draw and selection. For 1U, you scry 2 and draw two cards. In a deck that needs to find its pieces, this is gas. It's also an instant, so you can cast it at the end of your opponent's turn to dig without committing to the combo right away. It replaces itself and helps you hit your payoff cards. Drawing extra cards is crucial when you're trying to assemble a five-card combo.</p><h3>Omniscience</h3><p>The finisher. With infinite mana, you cast this sorcery and then cast every card in your hand for free. Typically you'll have X spells like Crackle with Power or a bunch of creatures. Once Omniscience resolves, the game ends. It's a 7-mana blue sorcery, but with infinite mana that's irrelevant. Drawing Omniscience is often the last piece you need, and Pore Over the Pages can help you find it.</p><h2>Typical Turn Sequence</h2><p>Turn 1: Play a basic, maybe a cantrip like Ponder or Brainstorm. Keep a hand with one of the key pieces.</p><p>Turn 2: Drop Lotus Field, sacrifice three lands (your basics, or use a sacrifice outlet if you have one). You now have three mana available.</p><p>Turn 3: Cast Thespian Stage as a copy of Lotus Field. You now have two Lotus Fields. Cast Pore Over the Pages to dig. Maybe find Blood Sun or another piece.</p><p>Turn 4: If you have Blood Sun, cast it. Then cast a tutor effect (like Vampiric Tutor or Mystical Tutor) to find an untap effect. Or use a card like Frantic Search to untap one of your Lotus Fields and draw cards. The goal is to generate infinite mana.</p><p>Turn 5: With infinite mana, cast Omniscience and then your win condition—usually a bunch of spells that deal damage or create a wide board.</p><p>It's not always that clean, but that's the ideal. The deck can also win by just generating a huge amount of mana and casting a big X spell directly, or by using multiple Thespian Stages to create multiple Lotus Fields and just going wide with creatures.</p><h2>Deckbuilding and Mana Base</h2><p>The mana base is crucial. You're playing Jeskai (blue, white, red) colors. You need to ensure you can cast Lotus Field on turn 2 reliably. That means plenty of blue sources and maybe some artifact lands or Moxen to accelerate. The deck often runs 4-5 Moxen (Mox Sapphire, Mox Jet, Mox Pearl, etc.) and the original duals and shocks. You also need ways to sacrifice lands, so cards like Lotus Field itself, or sacrifice outlets like Soul Exchange or Death-Breed, are helpful. But the deck can also just use Thespian Stage copying Lotus Field and Blood Sun to avoid needing to sacrifice more than three initially.</p><h2>Sideboard and Matchups</h2><p>Against control, you bring in more instant-speed interaction to protect your combo. Cards like Force of Will, Daze, and Spell Pierce are key. Against aggro, you might bring in wraths or defensive cards. The deck can also board into a more midrange plan with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Lightning Bolt to grind. The sideboard is flexible, but you need to preserve the core combo while adding hate for specific archetypes.</p><h2>Why This Deck Works in Vintage</h2><p>Vintage allows the most powerful cards ever printed. Moxen, Lotus Petal, Yawgmoth's Will—these help accelerate the combo. The card draw is insane with Ponder, Brainstorm, and Pore Over the Pages. The deck doesn't rely on the stack to protect itself as much as other combo decks; it's more about getting a board state that's hard to interact with. Blood Sun and Thespian Stage make the combo resilient. Once you have two Lotus Fields and Blood Sun, your opponent needs to destroy both Lotus Fields (which are lands) and Blood Sun to stop you. That's a tall order, especially with all the free mana you have to protect it.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>The Jeskai Lotus Combo deck is a beast in Vintage. It's explosive, consistent, and often kills by turn 4 or 5. It doesn't care about your life total; it's all about assembling the pieces and going off. If you're looking for a combo deck that's resilient and can win out of nowhere, this is it. The deck is still evolving—players are finding new builds, adding cards like Paradox Engine or more tutors. But the core five cards are the heart, and they're as nuts as they look. Try it at your next Vintage event, and watch your opponents' jaws drop when you tap for 12 mana on turn 4.</p>",
