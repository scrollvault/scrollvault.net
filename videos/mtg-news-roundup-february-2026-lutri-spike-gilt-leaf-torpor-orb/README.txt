VOICE TEXT:
First up—Lutri, the Spellchaser. This otter went from bulk to seventy-two dollars overnight. The Commander Format Panel unbanned it as your commander. The Halo Foil from Multiverse Legends? Seventy-two dollars.

VOICE TEXT:
Next—Gilt-Leaf Palace. This Lorwyn tribal land was supposed to get reprinted in Lorwyn Eclipsed. It didn't. Collectors panicked. Four dollars last week. Now? Eighteen and climbing. Old-border printings are spec targets.

VOICE TEXT:
Why is Gilt-Leaf Palace spiking? Meet High Perfect Morcant. This new legend is driving Elfball dominance. When a commander can spike a twenty-year-old land, you know the deck is real.

Finally—the sideboard king. Torpor Orb. Pro Tour Richmond was packed with ETB decks. Veterans reached for this. It climbed to twelve dollars and it's now a Standard mainstay.
