## Tech Stack

- **Static HTML/CSS/JS** -- no framework, no build-time bundling
- **Node.js build script** (`build.js`) generates article pages and hub pages from `data/posts.json`
- **Scryfall API** for card images, pricing, and land data (all fetched client-side or cached at build time)
- Hand-crafted tool pages with vanilla JavaScript

## Content Pipeline

Articles are researched, written, edited, fact-checked, and published daily through a multi-step editorial pipeline.

## Building the Site

```bash
# Generate all article and hub pages
node build.js

# Build to a staging directory
node build.js --staging
```

The build script reads `data/posts.json`, resolves card art via Scryfall, and writes static HTML pages. Tool pages are hand-crafted and not generated by the build script.

## Project Structure

```
build.js              # Site generator
data/posts.json       # Article content and metadata
data/card-cache.json  # Scryfall card art cache
style.css             # Shared stylesheet
tools/                # Interactive tool pages (hand-crafted HTML)
scripts/              # Utility scripts
posts/                # Generated article pages (build output)
```
