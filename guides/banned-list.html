            <p>The Banned &amp; Restricted list is one of the most impactful forces in competitive Magic. When a card gets banned, entire metagames shift overnight. This page covers the current banned and restricted cards across every major format, how bans work, and what to watch for.</p>

            <h2>How Bans Work</h2>
            <p>Wizards of the Coast monitors competitive data (win rates, metagame share, player sentiment) and issues Banned &amp; Restricted announcements roughly every 4-8 weeks. Cards are banned when they create unhealthy play patterns, suppress diversity, or push win rates beyond acceptable thresholds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Banned</strong> — The card cannot be included in your deck (main or sideboard)</li>
                <li><strong>Restricted</strong> — Only used in Vintage; the card is limited to 1 copy instead of 4</li>
                <li><strong>Suspended</strong> — Used on MTG Arena; temporarily removed while being evaluated</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Standard Banned Cards</h2>
            <p>Standard typically has a short ban list since the format self-corrects through rotation. When bans do happen, they target format-warping threats. Check Wizards' official announcements for the latest updates as Standard evolves with each new set release.</p>

            <h2>Pioneer Banned Cards</h2>
            <p>Pioneer's ban list was shaped heavily during the format's early years (2019-2021). Key permanent bans include the fetch lands (all 10), plus powerful combo and value engines that proved too dominant. The format is now relatively stable with infrequent changes.</p>

            <h2>Modern Banned Cards</h2>
            <p>Modern has the most active ban list history among 60-card formats. Iconic bans include Splinter Twin, Birthing Pod, Hogaak, and more recently various Modern Horizons cards. The Modern ban list shapes the format's identity as much as any legal card.</p>

            <h2>Legacy Banned Cards</h2>
            <p>Legacy bans target cards too powerful even with Force of Will as a safety valve. Recent years have seen bans targeting free spells and efficient threats that bypass Legacy's traditional answers.</p>

            <h2>Vintage Restricted List</h2>
            <p>Vintage restricts rather than bans most cards (only ante cards, dexterity cards, and Conspiracies are fully banned). The restricted list includes the most iconic cards in Magic's history: Black Lotus, Ancestral Recall, Time Walk, and the Moxen.</p>

            <h2>Commander Banned Cards</h2>
            <p>Commander bans are managed by the Commander Rules Committee (under Wizards oversight since late 2024). The Commander ban list focuses on cards that create unfun play patterns in multiplayer — fast mana, mass land destruction, and cards that end games immediately without interaction.</p>

            <h2>Pauper Banned Cards</h2>
            <p>Pauper bans target commons that create degenerate strategies. Despite being commons-only, several cards have proven too powerful including Storm combo pieces, efficient cantrips, and artifact lands.</p>

            <h2>When Is the Next B&amp;R Announcement?</h2>
            <p>Wizards typically announces B&amp;R updates on their official site and social media. Follow our <a href="/news/">MTG News</a> page for coverage of every announcement, including metagame analysis and what the bans mean for your decks.</p>
