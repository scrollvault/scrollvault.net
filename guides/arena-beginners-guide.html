    <script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Is MTG Arena free to play?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, MTG Arena is completely free to download and play. You earn gold through daily wins and quests, which can be spent on packs and events. While you can spend real money on gems for faster collection building, it is entirely possible to build competitive decks as a free-to-play player through smart resource management."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the best starter deck in MTG Arena?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The mono-colored starter decks are regularly updated, but historically the mono-red (aggressive) and mono-green (ramp) decks perform best for grinding daily wins. After completing the color challenges, pick a two-color starter deck that matches your play style. Upgrade whichever deck you enjoy most rather than spreading wildcards thin across multiple decks."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do wildcards work in MTG Arena?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Wildcards are special items that can be redeemed for any card of the same rarity. You get wildcards from opening packs (guaranteed at set intervals) and from the wildcard track. There are four tiers: common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare. Rare and mythic wildcards are the most valuable — spend them carefully on cards you know you need for a specific deck rather than speculative crafting."}}]}</script>

            <p>MTG Arena is the best way to play Magic: The Gathering digitally. Whether you're brand new to Magic or a tabletop veteran going digital, this guide covers everything you need to know to get started and build a competitive collection without breaking the bank.</p>
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Download MTG Arena for free on PC, Mac, iOS, or Android. The game starts with a tutorial that teaches basic mechanics through guided matches. After the tutorial, you'll unlock color challenges that reward you with a starter deck for each color.</p>
            <h2>The Economy: Gold, Gems, and Wildcards</h2>
            <h3>Gold</h3>
            <p>Gold is the free currency earned through daily wins (up to 750/day) and daily quests (500 or 750 each). Spend gold on packs (1,000 gold each) or event entries.</p>
            <h3>Gems</h3>
            <p>Gems are the premium currency, purchasable with real money or earnable through events. The best gem-to-value ratio comes from the highest gem bundle. Gems are needed for the Mastery Pass and some premium events.</p>
            <h3>Wildcards</h3>
            <p>Wildcards let you craft any card of matching rarity. You get them from opening packs at guaranteed intervals. Rare and mythic wildcards are precious — spend them on proven decks, not experiments.</p>
            <h2>Building Your First Competitive Deck</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pick one deck</strong> — Focus on a single competitive deck rather than building several mediocre ones</li>
                <li><strong>Start with a budget version</strong> — Many top decks have budget cores that work well at lower ranks</li>
                <li><strong>Upgrade gradually</strong> — Use wildcards to add the most impactful rares/mythics first</li>
                <li><strong>Check the meta</strong> — Visit our <a href="/decks/">top decks page</a> to see what's performing well</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Need help with your mana base? Our <a href="/tools/manabase/">Mana Base Calculator</a> works for Arena decks too.</p>
            <h2>Game Modes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Play (unranked):</strong> Casual matches with no stakes — great for testing new decks</li>
                <li><strong>Ranked:</strong> Climb from Bronze to Mythic in both Constructed and Limited. Rank resets each season.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick Draft:</strong> Draft against bots for 5,000 gold. Best value for building your collection and improving.</li>
                <li><strong>Premier Draft:</strong> Draft against humans for 10,000 gold or 1,500 gems. More competitive, better rewards.</li>
                <li><strong>Events:</strong> Rotating events with unique rules and rewards. Check the schedule for special events.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Free-to-Play Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete every daily quest — they're your primary gold income</li>
                <li>Get at least 4 daily wins each day (after 4, rewards drop off sharply)</li>
                <li>Rare-draft in Quick Draft to build your collection efficiently</li>
                <li>Save gold for the next set release — early drafting is the best value</li>
                <li>Never buy packs with gems — use gems for drafts and the Mastery Pass</li>
                <li>Don't craft cards until you have a complete decklist planned</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Understanding Formats on Arena</h2>
            <p>MTG Arena supports Standard, Alchemy, Explorer (similar to Pioneer), Historic, and Timeless. For a full breakdown, see our <a href="/guides/formats.html">MTG Formats Explained</a> guide. If you're interested in Commander, Arena offers Brawl (a 60-card variant) — check our <a href="/guides/commander-deck-building.html">Commander Deck Building Guide</a> for the full format.</p>
            <h2>Climbing the Ranked Ladder</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Play a deck you know well — consistency beats novelty in ranked</li>
                <li>Learn the meta and adjust your deck's answers accordingly</li>
                <li>Track your win rate — if it drops below 50%, take a break or switch decks</li>
                <li>Mythic rank requires sustained play, not just a high win rate</li>
            </ul>
