## EXAMPLE (follow this format exactly)

{
  "script": "Sol Ring just got banned in Commander and the community is losing it. This two-drop mana rock has been a staple since day one. Every deck ran it. Now it's gone. The Rules Committee says it warped the format too hard. Expect Mana Crypt to spike next. If you're holding copies, sell now. The Commander meta just changed forever.",

## HARD LIMITS — VIOLATING THESE FAILS THE TASK

- **80-150 words TOTAL** across all scenes combined. Count your words. A 30-60 second video at 1.1x speed is about 100-130 spoken words.
- **3-5 scenes only.** Each scene is 1-3 sentences.
- **Each scene under 35 words.**
- **show_avatar must alternate.** At least one scene MUST be show_avatar: false. Card reveal and showcase scenes should be false so the card art fills the screen.
- **card_name must EXACTLY match an entry from AVAILABLE CARDS.** Copy it character for character.
- **NEVER invent card names.** Only use cards from the AVAILABLE CARDS list.
- **NEVER reference Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon, Hearthstone, or any non-MTG game.**
- **JSON only.** No ```json fences. No text before or after the JSON object.

## show_avatar field

- **true** = Small avatar circle in bottom-right corner. Card art is the background. Use for: hooks, hot takes, calls to action.
- **false** = No avatar. Full-screen card art with voiceover. Use for: card reveals, showcasing card details, dramatic moments.

## Voice Style

Energetic MTG content creator. Short punchy sentences. Card name-drops. MTG slang fine (jank, busted, staple, meta, ETB, goes infinite). Hook that stops the scroll.
