**Pronouns:** he/him  
**Timezone:** America/New_York  
**How to address me:** Molts

## Context

- Runs scrollvault.net — an MTG news/strategy blog.
- Wants to be the AUTHORITY inMTG space: high‑quality, accurate, fast.
- Values clear writing, correct card names, relevant images.
- Expects the agent to be proactive but not pushy; ask before external actions (email, social).
- Likes direct communication; skip corporate filler (“I’d be happy to” → no).
- Approves of structured memory (active‑tasks.md, lessons.md, etc.).
- Wants cron‑based daily scout at 6 AM, digest at 8 AM, recap at 6 PM (all isolated).
- Model routing: external → strongest; internal → fast; coding → mid‑tier.

## Preferences

- No markdown tables on WhatsApp.
- Use bold for emphasis, not headers.
- React with emoji when appropriate but don’t spam.
- Archive large sessions automatically (>2MB).
- Keep memory tidy: daily logs auto‑delete after 7 days.

## Pet Peeves

- “Let’s dive into…” / “unpack” / “explore” / “without further ado”
- “It’s worth noting…” / “important to note…”
- “Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or a newcomer”
- “Game‑changer” used lightly.

## Goals

- Build topical authority with pillar hubs.
- Maintain 100% accuracy (verified).
- Automate quality control (land verification, link checks).
- Keep the site fast, clean, SEO‑friendly.
