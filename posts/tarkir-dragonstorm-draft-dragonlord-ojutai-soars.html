</div>

<p>The format is defined by high threat density. Commons and uncommons are solid, but the rares and mythics are where the real bombs live. You'll see a lot of three- and even four-color decks because the fixing-especially the Khans fetches and the Fate Reforged tri-lands-is good enough to make it work. That said, two-color aggro is still a real strategy, especially if you curve out with cheap creatures and tempo spells. The key is knowing which dragons to pick and how to build around them.</p>

<h3>The Five Dragons That Define the Format</h3>

<p>Let's talk about the headliners. These are the cards you want to build around, and they often dictate the pace of the draft.</p>

<h4><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDragonlord%2520Ojutai" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/a/9/a9f39d28-08eb-4eff-ae55-abd377877a27.jpg?1673485045" target="_blank">Dragonlord Ojutai</a> (U/W)</h4>
<p>Three mana for a 4/4 flying, hexproof creature is already great. The scry 2 when it enters is the icing on the cake. Ojutai comes down early, dodges most removal, and immediately starts filtering your draws. The +1 ability exiles a permanent, which can shut down an opponent's key threat. And if the game goes long, that -8 emblem means you'll control every Dragon on the battlefield, turning the tide completely. In draft, Ojutai is an easy first-pick and will win games on its own in any blue-white or Jeskai deck.</p>

<h4><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDragonlord%2520Silumgar" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/9/e/9ee837b8-c280-4a5b-acdf-71247ab096f5.jpg?1673148531" target="_blank">Dragonlord Silumgar</a> (U/B)</h4>
<p>At five mana, Silumgar is a 5/5 flyer with hexproof. Its enters-the-battlefield effect is brutal: you look at your opponent's hand and exile a nonland card, stripping their best threat or answer. The +1 deals 1 damage to a player or planeswalker-great for finishing off a planeswalker or chipping away. The -3 bounces a creature, giving you tempo. The emblem at -8 draws you two cards whenever you cast a Dragon, fueling your late-game. Silumgar is a powerhouse in Dimir or Sultai control decks that want to grind the opponent down.</p>

<h4><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDragonlord%2520Atarka" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/4/d411ad43-3718-4ed7-932f-fcea28705782.jpg?1743207104" target="_blank">Dragonlord Atarka</a> (R/G)</h4>
<p>Atarka is a 5/5 trample flying dragon for three red and two green. That's a beating. Its ETBF can destroy any creature with power 4 or greater, which deals with opposing bombs. The +1 pumps it by +2/+0 and gives trample until end of turn, making it a terrifying attacker. The -3 deals 5 damage to any creature, and the -8 emblem boosts all your Dragons to 5/5 with flying. Atarka is the perfect finisher for Gruul or Temur stompy decks that want to go over the top.</p>

<h4><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DSarkhan%2520Unbroken" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/1/9/192452f8-93c2-4a20-a52b-0093741a9e45.jpg?1562783094" target="_blank">Sarkhan Unbroken</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DSarkhan%2520Unbroken" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/1/9/192452f8-93c2-4a20-a52b-0093741a9e45.jpg?1562783094" target="_blank">Sarkhan Unbroken</a> is a red planeswalker that comes in at three loyalty. His +1 deals 2 damage to any target-excellent for removing small creatures or pinging planeswalkers. The -3 creates a 5/5 red Dragon token with flying, which is an immediate threat. And his -7 emblem gives you Dragon pings: whenever a Dragon attacks, it deals 4 damage to any target. That's insane reach. Sarkhan is a bomb in Mardu or Temur aggro-control decks that can protect him for a turn or two.</p>

<h4>Savage Knuckleblade (R/G)</h4>
<p>This two-mana 2/2 Human Berserker with prowess might not look like much until you realize it's a 4/4 on turn three after you cast a bounce spell or a combat trick. Knuckleblade is the quintessential aggressive two-drop that curves into any noncreature spells. It's especially potent in Gruul or Temur decks that are spellslingers and want to apply early pressure. If you have even one noncreature spell in hand, Knuckleblade becomes a terror that your opponent must answer immediately or die.</p>

<h2>Archetype Breakdown: Which Clans Want Which Dragons?</h2>

<p>The five clans from Tarkir still form the backbone of the format, but each has a different relationship with the Dragonlords.</p>

<h3>Jeskai (U/R/W)</h3>
<p>Jeskai is the natural home for <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDragonlord%2520Ojutai" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/a/9/a9f39d28-08eb-4eff-ae55-abd377877a27.jpg?1673485045" target="_blank">Dragonlord Ojutai</a>. The deck plays a high density of instants and sorceries to trigger prowess on creatures like <em>Monastery Swiftspear</em> and to protect Ojutai. You'll want to play a mix of cheap spells and evasive threats. Ojutai fits like a glove, providing a late-game finisher that's hard to deal with. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DSarkhan%2520Unbroken" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/1/9/192452f8-93c2-4a20-a52b-0093741a9e45.jpg?1562783094" target="_blank">Sarkhan Unbroken</a> also finds a home here because the red spells complement the blue-white base.</p>

<h3>Sultai (B/G/U)</h3>
<p>Sultai is a graveyard-centric delve deck that also loves control elements. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDragonlord%2520Silumgar" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/9/e/9ee837b8-c280-4a5b-acdf-71247ab096f5.jpg?1673148531" target="_blank">Dragonlord Silumgar</a> is a perfect top-end threat because you can spend the early game setting up your board and controlling the opponent, then drop Silumgar to exile their hand. The delve creatures are great at filling the graveyard, and Silumgar's abilities give you a way to close out the game even if your graveyard is empty. Pair Silumgar with some removal and you've got a deck that can grind out wins.</p>

<h3>Mardu (R/W/B)</h3>
<p>Mardu is all about raid and aggressive creatures. Savage Knuckleblade is a star here because you'll be casting cheap noncreature spells to trigger raid effects. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DSarkhan%2520Unbroken" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/1/9/192452f8-93c2-4a20-a52b-0093741a9e45.jpg?1562783094" target="_blank">Sarkhan Unbroken</a> adds a powerful planeswalker that can stabilize the board or provide a huge Dragon token. The deck is fast and can win on turn five with a well-timed Knuckleblade or a Sarkhan ultimate. Don't sleep on Mardu-it's one of the most consistent aggro decks in the format.</p>

<h3>Temur (G/U/R)</h3>
<p>Temur is the ferocious clan that loves big creatures and spells. Both <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDragonlord%2520Atarka" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/4/d411ad43-3718-4ed7-932f-fcea28705782.jpg?1743207104" target="_blank">Dragonlord Atarka</a> and Savage Knuckleblade fit right in. You can use cheap spells to prowess creatures and then drop Atarka to trample over everything. The deck often goes bigger than Gruul because it can splash blue for counterspells and card draw, making it more resilient. Atarka's ability to destroy big creatures is huge in a meta full of other dragons.</p>

<h3>Gruul (R/G)</h3>
<p>Gruul is pure stompy: you want to curve out with creatures and attack. Savage Knuckleblade and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDragonlord%2520Atarka" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/4/d411ad43-3718-4ed7-932f-fcea28705782.jpg?1743207104" target="_blank">Dragonlord Atarka</a> are the top-end. You'll play a lot of two- and three-drops that hit hard, and you don't care much about interaction-you just want to race. Atarka's ability to destroy opposing threats is a huge upgrade from most gruul decks. If you can survive to turn five, you'll likely win.</p>

<h3>Abzan (W/B/G)</h3>
<p>Abzan is the +1/+1 counter archetype with outlast. It's midrange and grindy, but it lacks a natural dragon finisher. You might splash for Ojutai or Silumgar if you open them, but they're not in your colors. Abzan is more about incremental advantage and board presence. It's playable, but it's not where you want to be if you're hunting for the big dragons.</p>

<h2>Commons & Uncommons That Hold It Together</h2>
<p>Beyond the bombs, the format's backbone consists of solid commons and uncommons. In Jeskai, you want <em>Monastery Swiftspear</em>, <em>Valeron Outpost</em>, and <em>Mantis Rider</em>. In Sultai, <em>Treasure Cruise</em> and delve creatures like <em>Sidisi, Undead Vizier</em> are nuts. Mardu loves <em>Mardu Hordechief</em> and <em>Lightning Strike</em>. Temur and Gruul both want <em>Rattleclaw Mystic</em> and <em>Sarkhan's Unsealing</em>. And white's <em>Merciless Executioner</em> is a great removal spell that trades up. The fixing is also crucial: cards like <em>Evolving Wilds</em>, <em>Fetid Pools</em>, and <em>Canopy Vista</em> are must-plays if you're playing three colors. Don't underestimate the power of a good mana base-it's what enables those greedy dragon decks.</p>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
