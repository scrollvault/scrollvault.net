<h2>The Perfect Storm of Abilities</h2>

<p>Start with the real kicker: her +1 ability exiles up to one target card from a graveyard. That's already relevant against Sheoldred decks, against reanimator, against any graveyard strategy. Then it says: 'You may discard a card. If you do, draw a card.' That's <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDark%2520Confidant" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/2/5/2520ab23-a068-4462-b261-2754409b4108.jpg?1748706117" target="_blank">Dark Confidant</a> in loyalty ability form. And to top it off, 'Each opponent discards a card.' On the play, turn 2 you <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a> them, turn 3 you +1 this, discard a land to draw, and they discard another card. That's not fair.</p>

<p>The -3 creates two 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens. Not the most exciting, but it fills the board, provides bodies for Aristocrats strategies, and can pressure planeswalkers. Solid rate and ensures she's not a brick when you need blockers.</p>

<p>Then the -7: choose an opponent. Exile all cards from their graveyard. You may cast a creature or sorcery card from among those exiled cards without paying its mana cost. That's a one-way reanimation spell. On the play, turn 4 you slam this (with a <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DFatal%2520Push" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/6/e/6e9d8fe4-fd9b-4923-92bf-7dd6b8fa02e7.jpg?1598304715" target="_blank">Fatal Push</a> backup), turn 5 you -7 and steal their Sheoldred. Game over.</p>

<h2>Synergy with the Deck We All Play</h2>

<p>The synergy with existing cards is what makes this truly broken. In a Standard full of <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DFatal%2520Push" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/6/e/6e9d8fe4-fd9b-4923-92bf-7dd6b8fa02e7.jpg?1598304715" target="_blank">Fatal Push</a>, and Sheoldred the Apocalypse, this Liliana becomes the linchpin. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDark%2520Confidant" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/2/5/2520ab23-a068-4462-b261-2754409b4108.jpg?1748706117" target="_blank">Dark Confidant</a> already rewards you for discarding - now you have a planeswalker that makes them discard and draws you cards. That's insane. The -7 directly fuels into Sheoldred's ability, letting you cheat the big creature into play while your opponent stares at an empty graveyard.</p>

<p>Consider the Standard shell: 4 <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>, 4 <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DFatal%2520Push" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/6/e/6e9d8fe4-fd9b-4923-92bf-7dd6b8fa02e7.jpg?1598304715" target="_blank">Fatal Push</a>, 4 <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDark%2520Confidant" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/2/5/2520ab23-a068-4462-b261-2754409b4108.jpg?1748706117" target="_blank">Dark Confidant</a>, 4 Sheoldred the Apocalypse, and 4 of this new Liliana. That's not a deck - that's a statement. You curve out with <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a> on turn 1, Liliana on turn 3 with a <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DFatal%2520Push" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/6/e/6e9d8fe4-fd9b-4923-92bf-7dd6b8fa02e7.jpg?1598304715" target="_blank">Fatal Push</a> backup, and by turn 5 you're dropping Sheoldred for free off her ultimate. Your opponent is top-decking while you have a 6/6 deathtouch flyer and two Zombie tokens.</p>

<h2>Pioneer Is Even Worse</h2>

<p>Standard is bad enough, but Pioneer is a nightmare. Pioneer enables even more powerful graveyard strategies. Cards like Grisly Salvage, Cathartic Reunion, and even more efficient enablers mean this Liliana's abilities are even more potent. The -7 might as well say 'win the game' against many Pioneer decks that rely on their graveyard as a resource.</p>

<p>Control decks would play her as a one-card win condition. Midrange decks would use her as their engine. Even Aristocrats decks gain from the discard and token generation. It's a four-of in every black deck that cares about its graveyard - which is all of them.</p>

<h2>Is This Too Good?</h2>

<p>I'm not sold on the -7 being too strong in a vacuum - reanimation spells exist already - but having it on a planeswalker that already gains you value with her +1 is what breaks it. You can use her loyalty ability multiple times before you ultimate, so she's not a one-trick pony. She's a threat that demands an answer immediately, and if they don't have it, you just win.</p>

<p>The real question: how does this not break everything? The answer is, it probably does. I expect Wizards to reprint this at a higher mana cost or with restrictions, but if it drops as is? Standard and Pioneer are about to get a whole lot more oppressive. My wallet is ready - are yours?</p>
<h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
<p>Put Liliana in the “turn-3 wrecking ball” folder. Her +1 turns every graveyard into value for you and a landfill for them, which means ramp decks just lost their fuel and mid-range decks just lost their backup plan. Pair her with [[<em><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DDark%2520Confidant" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/2/5/2520ab23-a068-4462-b261-2754409b4108.jpg?1748706117" target="_blank">Dark Confidant</a>]]]&nbsp;to hit your outs faster, or with [[<em><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>]]]&nbsp;to force them to discard the answer to her first.  She’s not just discard—she’s discard-plus-draw-plus-lock in three loyalty steps.</p>
<p>In Standard the line is brutally simple: turn-2 [[<em><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>]]] &rarr; turn-3 Liliana +1 &rarr; turn-4 [[<em>Sheoldred the Apocalypse]]] plus counters in back pocket.  That sequence averages a **seven-turn** kill with no attack step if you hit both halves.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>If decks curve Liliana on curve, expect [[<em>Leyline of the Void]] &nbsp;spikes and [[<em>Rest in Peace]]]&nbsp;to rise to pre-board main-deck staples by GP Richmond. Play her or prepare to hate her—the graveyard meta just got flipped like a foil <em>Delver of Secrets</em>.</p>
<h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
<p>Control decks slot [[<em>Liliana]]]&nbsp;four-of and [[<em><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>]]]&nbsp;curve into five-mana graveyard theft on turn six. Mid-range lists pivot to [[<em>Graveyard Trespasser]]]&nbsp;plus [[<em>Doomsday Excruciator]]]&nbsp;loops, turning every opponent card into value removal packages countering threat curves over time.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Expect [[<em>Leyline]]]&nbsp;and [[<em>Rest in Peace]]]&nbsp;spikes until July b&r slate decides Liliana fate. Play to graveyard lockouts or be locked— meta curve now reads [[<em>counterspell]]]&nbsp;plus [[<em>reanimation]]]&nbsp;equals win on turn five.</p>
<h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
<p>Liliana turns every discard spell into a three-for-one: exile grave value, force a discard, and draw a replacement. In Standard the line [[<em><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>]]] → [[<em>Liliana +1 →]]] [[<em>Sheoldred]]]&nbsp;puts the game on a turn-five lock. Combo shells slot her as a graveyard hate / value engine to beat [[<em>Kroxa]]]&nbsp;or [[<em>Reanimator]]].</p>
<p>Legacy brewers eye [[<em>Force of Will]]]&nbsp;plus [[<em>Liliana -7]]] as a one-card [[<em>Reanimate]]], stealing [[<em>Grave Titan]]] through removal.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Until the next b&r, sleeve four copies and [[<em>Leyline of the Void]]]. The meta’s new curve is “counter → discard → win,” and Liliana sits at the apex.</p>
