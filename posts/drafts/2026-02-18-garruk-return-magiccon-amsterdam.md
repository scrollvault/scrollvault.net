---

A single piece of art on the MagicCon Amsterdam 2026 website has sparked widespread speculation across the Magic community. The image features Garruk, the iconic hunter-planeswalker whose last new card appeared in 2019 with *Wildcards of Wilds*. After six years without a fresh mechanical identity, Garruk's absence has been one of the longest and most keenly felt by fans. The promotional illustration tied to MagicCon Amsterdam 2026 shows Garruk prominently, accompanied by messaging that indicates a return is imminent. For lore enthusiasts and competitive players alike, this is more than a teaser—it's a signal that one of Magic's most beloved characters is poised for a major comeback.

Garruk's significance in Magic's narrative and mechanical history cannot be overstated. Introduced in the original Lorwyn block, Garruk was the first planeswalker to appear on a Magic card (*Garruk Wildspeaker*) and became an instant favorite due to his rough-hewn design, potent abilities, and compelling character arc. From his cursed beastly transformation to his quest for redemption, Garruk has anchored storylines across multiple planes and sets. A return wouldn't just be another card release; it would be an event that reconnected dots in Magic's ongoing saga while potentially reshaping competitive tournament play.

## The Garruk We Last Saw: A Quick Recap

To understand why this tease matters, let's trace Garruk's recent timeline:

- **2019**: *Garruk Wildspeaker* (reprint) and *Garruk, Cursed Huntsman* appear in Core Set 2020. That's the last time we saw a new Garruk card.
- **2020-2023**: Garruk appears in story content (particularly in Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths and Midnight Hunt) but receives no new cards.
- **2024**: Garruk absent from major releases; fan speculation about his fate grows.
- **2025**: Some Garruk references in Commander sets but no new card.
- **2026**: MagicCon Amsterdam art suggests return.

During this six-year drought, Garruk has been referenced in various set stories—he was involved in the events of Innistrad: Midnight Hunt, hunting monsters on the cursed plane—but mechanically, he's been MIA. Meanwhile, other iconic planeswalkers like Jace, Chandra, and Liliana have continued to receive updates, new versions, and Commander precons. Garruk's omission became something of a running joke and frustration among players who see him as an essential piece of Magic's identity.

## Why Garruk Remains a Fan Favorite

What makes Garruk so beloved? A few factors:

1. **Mechanical Impact**: Garruk's abilities typically combine creature-based aggression with card advantage—a potent mix in midrange and stompy decks. *Garruk Wildspeaker*'s "untap all creatures" combo with crew vehicles or effects like *Avenger of Zendikar* became a staple in various Standard and Modern builds. *Garruk, Cursed Huntsman*'s deathtouch and -3/-2 effect made him a versatile removal-plus-threat.

2. **Character Depth**: Unlike some planeswalkers whose personalities blur together, Garruk has a clear arc—pride, curse, suffering, redemption. His interactions with other characters (especially Nissa, who helped heal his curse) added emotional weight. He's been through hell and emerged a better version of himself.

3. **Aesthetic Appeal**: The hunter aesthetic—claws, animal skins, primal weaponry—distinguishes him from the more mystical or scholarly walkers. That visual identity translates beautifully to card art.

4. **Format Versatility**: Garruk has seen play across multiple formats—Standard, Modern, Pioneer, Commander. Players who collect and play in different environments appreciate a walker with broad utility.

Given all that, the six-year gap feels unusually long, especially as Wizards continues to mine its well of older characters for new versions. The MagicCon Amsterdam art is exactly the kind of subtle fanservice that suggests development teams are actively working on a Garruk-centric product.

## MagicCon Amsterdam 2026 and the Teaser Context

MagicCon Amsterdam is scheduled for mid-2026, and the promotional material prominently features Garruk alongside other planeswalkers like *Nissa* and *Kiora*. This grouping hints at a possible return to the Multiverse's nature-focused planes (Zendikar? Lorwyn?) or an event tied to the Great Aurora or other planar phenomena that could draw characters from disparate worlds together.

The specific pose and art style could indicate a new Garruk that's either:

- **A Garruk "un-cursed"**—fully healed and perhaps more powerful
- **A Garruk "hunter reborn"**—taking his primal abilities to new extremes
- **A Garruk "planeswalker mentor"**—reflecting his growth and experience
- **A classic Garruk reimagined for a new plane**

The teaser's timing—roughly a year before Amsterdam—follows Wizards' pattern of revealing major story beats and returning characters at conventions and through website banners. We'll likely see a proper reveal during the set's preview season, possibly alongside other returning favorites.

## How Wizards Might Reintegrate Garruk

Reintegrating a long-absent planeswalker into current Magic story requires careful handling. The narrative team has several options:

1. **Direct Return**: Garruk shows up in a Standard set, perhaps as part of a "returning heroes" theme alongside other classic walkers. This would be the simplest and most expected approach.

2. **Set Protagonist**: Make Garruk the central character of an entire set—maybe a return to Lorwyn or a new plane where his curse resurfaces. This would give him maximum narrative weight and justify multiple card appearances (traditional walker, transforms, etc.).

3. **Commander Focus**: While likely not the primary path, Garruk could headline a Commander precon, especially a "nature vs. technology" or "hunter's challenge" theme. This would satisfy Commander players but leave Standard formats out.

4. **Mythic Rare in a Core Set**: A straightforward but less splashy option—Garruk as a mythic rare in Magic Core Set 2027. This would ensure wide distribution but might feel anticlimactic after six years.

Given Garruk's history and the excitement his return generates, the bet would be on either (1) or (2). A Standard set that ties into a larger story about the remnants of the *Eldrazi* or the *Coalition* would be fitting. Alternatively, a return to *Eldraine* (where Garruk appeared in *Throne of Eldraine*) could pair him with the fairy tale setting that suited his aesthetic so well.

## Competitive Implications: What Might Garruk Look Like Mechanically?

This is where speculation gets serious for competitive players. Garruk's past abilities suggest certain patterns:

- **+1:** "Target creature you control gains +X/+X and trample until end of turn" (Wildspeaker)
- **-3:** "Destroy target creature" or "-3/-2" (Cursed Huntsman)
- **-6:** "You get an emblem with 'Whenever a creature enters under your control, you may draw a card'" (Cursed Huntsman)
- **Starting Loyalty:** Typically 4 or 5

A new Garruk could refine these patterns, introduce new abilities, or shift his color identity. Historically, Garruk has been Golgari (black-green), but he's also appeared as Abzan (white-black-green) in some story contexts. The color identity will heavily dictate what formats he might impact.

**Potential Modern/Pioneer Play Patterns:**

- **Midrange Value Engine**: A Garruk that generates advantage over time but dies toihilation could fit Jund or Golgari midrange strategies.
- **Combo Enabler**: If his +1 untaps creatures, he could power up vehicle or storm strategies.
- **Ramp Finisher**: If his abilities involve creature-based ramp or large creature creation, he could join the ramp archetype.

As with any planeswalker, the mana cost will be crucial. A 4-mana Garruk with 5 loyalty would be a bomb in Pioneer; a 5-mana one might be too slow. The defense of his starting loyalty determines whether he survives the turn he enters.

## Conclusion: The Wait Continues, But Hope Is alive

The MagicCon Amsterdam 2026 art featuring Garruk is more than just a generic promotional illustration—it's a calculated tease from Wizards, acknowledging the character's absence and promising resolution. For a player base that has been denied a new Garruk for nearly a decade, this is validation that the wait is almost over. Whether Garruk returns in a Standard set, a Commander deck, or as a special promotional card, we can expect a reveal sometime in 2026—likely around the Amsterdam convention or earlier. Until then, speculation will run wild on art Discord servers and Twitter threads. One thing's certain: when Garruk finally picks up his axe again, Magic's lore and competitive landscapes will both feel the impact.
