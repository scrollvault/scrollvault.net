<h2>The Format Is Faster Than You Think</h2><p>Look, I've cracked enough packs to know: Ravnica Remastered isn't your grandma's guild draft. The power level is up, the format is faster, and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DBoros%2520Charm" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/e/0/e0d8c9f6-cbbd-4694-b100-01cfb81036cc.jpg?1736305704" target="_blank">Boros Charm</a> is nuts. If you see that red two-mana symbol, you snap it. No question.</p>

</div><p>Everybody wants to talk about Niv-Mizzet Parun being the bomb, but let's be real: that card's a luxury. You're not casting that on turn 5 most games. You need to curve out, put pressure on, and close before your opponent can stabilize. That's where Boros and Izzet shine.</p><h3>S-Tier: The Format's Actual Kings</h3><p><strong>Boros (RW)</strong> - This guild is gas. The combination of cheap creatures, burn spells, and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DBoros%2520Charm" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/e/0/e0d8c9f6-cbbd-4694-b100-01cfb81036cc.jpg?1736305704" target="_blank">Boros Charm</a> creates a tempo machine that can close from any board state. You're playing creatures that curve nicely into combat tricks that win fights, then back it up with direct damage. If you're on the play, turn 1 Steppe Lynx into turn 2 <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DBoros%2520Charm" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/e/0/e0d8c9f6-cbbd-4694-b100-01cfb81036cc.jpg?1736305704" target="_blank">Boros Charm</a> is often enough to put your opponent on a 2-turn clock. The threat density is insane and you don't rely on drawing specific cards to win.</p><p><strong>Izzet (UR)</strong> - The spell-slinger dream is real. With cards like Sphinx Revelation drawing you a grip and Niv-Mizzet Parun lighting up the board, Izzet can go from zero to hero in one turn. The key is surviving early with cheap spells and cantrips until you can untap with a big draw spell. Watch your mana curve though - too many high-costed spells and you'll brick badly.</p><h3>A-Tier: Strong and Consistent</h3><p><strong>Dimir (UB)</strong> - Surveil is still a thing, and it's better than you remember. You can filter through your deck while getting value, and Deathrite Shaman provides early advantage and life swing. Dimir decks play the long game, forcing discards and slowly out-resourcing your opponent. If thepod, you might need to adjust, but this guild is legit.</p><p><strong>Orzhov (WB)</strong> - Midrange grindy value. Cards like Assassin Trophy giving you unconditional removal and card advantage makes Orzhov a solid second pick after the top tiers. You'll have tons of small creatures that go wide and removal to control the board until you can drop a bomb. Not as explosive as Boros but very consistent.</p><p><strong>Rakdos (BR)</strong> - Discard and aggression. Rakdos can be brutal if you draw the right sequence: early discard to strip their answers, then waste a turn, then resolve a creature that just wins. It's a high-skill guild that rewards knowing when to be the profit. Not as consistent as Boros but can dominate when it comes together.</p><h3>B-Tier: Playable When The Stars Align</h3><p><strong>Golgari (BG)</strong> - Ramp and value. The graveyard strategies can be powerful, especially if you hit a Deathrite Shaman early for acceleration. But sometimes you just don't draw your ramp and you're stuck playing 2-drops on turn 4. It's a high-variance guild that can dominate or fizzle.</p><p><strong>Gruul (RG)</strong> - Pure aggro. Crushes slower decks but folds to any form of board wipe. If you can go fast and your opponents are durdling, you'll win. But if you get behind, recovery is tough. The mana curve is brutal and you'll often find yourself top-decking for gas.</p><p><strong>Simic (UG)</strong> - Big butt, big value? Simic creatures are massive but cost a ton. You'll often be playing catch-up early and hoping to stabilize. If the format slows down, Simic can dominate with threat density. But against Boros or Izzet, you might die before casting your four-drop.</p><h3>Trap Tier: These Are Tilt</h3><p><strong>Selesnya (GW)</strong> - I'm sorry, but this guild is a trap. The tokens strategy is too slow, the creatures don't have enough power for their cost, and you're vulnerable to any form of removal. You need to go wide, but your cards don't support that plan until too late. Unless you open aSelesnya Signet in pack 2, avoid.</p><p><strong>Azorius (UW)</strong> - Flyers and control sounds good in theory, but the creatures are so fragile. One Edict effect and your whole plan falls apart. The tempo is weak and you spend too much time reacting instead of attacking. You'll brick on mana often with islands and plains. Passable as a splash, but a main guild? No thanks.</p><h3>The Card Truths That Win Games</h3><p>Let's talk about the key cards you need to evaluate correctly:</p><p><strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DBoros%2520Charm" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/e/0/e0d8c9f6-cbbd-4694-b100-01cfb81036cc.jpg?1736305704" target="_blank">Boros Charm</a></strong> - This is the best common in the format. It's a combat trick that wins fights, protects your team from removal, and can even prevent damage to you from burn spells. I've won games by simply having this in hand and using it to push through the last points. Never play around it - you can't.</p><p><strong>Deathrite Shaman</strong> - The mana fixing is irrelevant - the lifegain and life loss is what makes this card. It turns any wasteland into a meaningful attack. Against control, it's a two-turn clock by itself. Against aggro, it stabilizes you. Play it in any black or green deck, even if you're not full on either color.</p><p><strong>Sphinx Revelation</strong> - The legendary card draw spell. You need to be in blue, obviously, but it's worth splashing if you have enough blue sources. The card advantage is insane - drawing 5-7 cards is common. Couple it with Niv-Mizzet Parun and you have a combo that wins out of nowhere.</p><p><strong>Niv-Mizzet Parun</strong> - The mythic that changes games. You don't need a specific deck to play it - any UR deck that can cast it wins. The synergy with any instant or sorcery means even your removal spells draw you cards. This is a card you'll pick highly even if you're not in Izzet, just to splash.</p><p><strong>Assassin Trophy</strong> - The best removal in the format. destroys anything, and the downside is negligible in draft. It's card advantage for your opponent? Who cares - you just removed their bomb. Play this in any black deck, and sometimes splash it into other colors if you need an out.</p><h3>Drafting Tips</h3><p>The trick is: prioritize Boros and Izzet early, but be ready to pivot. If pack 2 is weak in those colors, Dimir, Orzhov, and Rakdos are great backups. Avoid Selesnya and Azorius main unless you wheel a bomb. Read the table - if multiple players are forcing Boros, you might be the only one at a Izzet table.</p><p>Curve out and apply pressure. This format rewards going wide and going fast. Boros and Izzet both have ways to close quickly with leftover mana. Play the creatures that attack, not just wall up.</p><p>Finally, keep your eye on the prize: it's all about getting to 6-7 damage per turn consistently. If your deck can't do that, it's probably not good enough.</p>
