<h2>The Lutri Effect: An Unban Spike for the Ages</h2>
<p><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DLutri%252C%2520the%2520Spellchaser" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/f/b/fb1189c9-7842-466e-8238-1e02677d8494.jpg?1770634934" target="_blank">Lutri, the Spellchaser</a> went from bulk bin to hype beast practically overnight. After the Commander Format Panel unbanned the otter (still banned as a companion, but free to be your commander or a 99-card), prices exploded. Normal copies settled around $6, but the Halo Foil from Multiverse Legends? That's sitting at $72. I've never seen a Commander unban move the market this fast. Players are rushing to build Izzet spell-slinger decks, and the otter is the centerpiece. This is the definition of an unban spike—everyone knew it was coming, but the demand still caught supply off guard.</p>

<h2><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DGilt-Leaf%2520Palace" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/c/c/cc4bbbb5-4218-4b2a-9ca2-de4d5f5dda19.jpg?1562368244" target="_blank">Gilt-Leaf Palace</a>: The Land That Never Was (Reprinted)</h2>
<p>Here's a card that shouldn't be hot but is: <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DGilt-Leaf%2520Palace" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/c/c/cc4bbbb5-4218-4b2a-9ca2-de4d5f5dda19.jpg?1562368244" target="_blank">Gilt-Leaf Palace</a>. The original Lorwyn tribal land was omitted from Lorwyn Eclipsed's reprint cycle, and collectors panicked. With Elfball decks dominating thanks to new legends like <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DHigh%2520Perfect%2520Morcant" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/f/dfe7b8bf-c150-4be0-aef4-e8bb6f09787a.jpg?1765451570" target="_blank">High Perfect Morcant</a>, this mana-fixer became essential overnight. A $4 bulk rare? That was last week. Now it's $18 and climbing. The lesson: Wizards skips a reprint, the market responds. Old-border, original-print <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DGilt-Leaf%2520Palace" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/c/c/cc4bbbb5-4218-4b2a-9ca2-de4d5f5dda19.jpg?1562368244" target="_blank">Gilt-Leaf Palace</a> is now a spec target. Hold onto yours—if it doesn't show up in a future set, this could be a $50 land.</p>

<h2><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DTorpor%2520Orb" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/b/dbf02a38-d10d-463e-ab99-e7fd848a1bd3.jpg?1770090426" target="_blank">Torpor Orb</a>: The Sideboard King of Pro Tour Richmond</h2>
<p>When a meta gets crowded with enter-the-battlefield triggers, veterans reach for <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DTorpor%2520Orb" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/b/dbf02a38-d10d-463e-ab99-e7fd848a1bd3.jpg?1770090426" target="_blank">Torpor Orb</a>. Pro Tour Richmond was dominated by Dimir Excruciator decks that rely on ETB effects to grind out value. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DTorpor%2520Orb" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/b/dbf02a38-d10d-463e-ab99-e7fd848a1bd3.jpg?1770090426" target="_blank">Torpor Orb</a> shuts them down cold. The artifact climbed to $12 this week and is now a mainstay in any sideboard trying to survive the Standard ladder. It's a hoser, plain and simple—you stop them and they can't stop you from stopping them. I'm running two in my Sultai Midrange sideboard and I'm not cutting them anytime soon. If you're not playing <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DTorpor%2520Orb" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/b/dbf02a38-d10d-463e-ab99-e7fd848a1bd3.jpg?1770090426" target="_blank">Torpor Orb</a> right now, you're behind.</p>

<h2>Chronicle of Victory: Typal Payoff That Actually Delivers</h2>
<p>Chronicle of Victory is the must-have card for any kindred deck in Standard. For six mana, it gives your chosen creature type +2/+2, first strike, trample, and turns every creature spell into a cantrip. That's insane value, especially in colors that struggle with card draw. Players aren't complaining about the alleged power creep over Vanquisher's Banner—they're just happy to have it. The card peaked at $24 and is staying there. If you're playing Elf, Dwarf, or any tribal synergies in Standard, you need four of these. It's non-negotiable.</p>

<h2>Deceit Cools Off: The Mythic Correction Arrives</h2>
<p>Deceit had a moment. The blue Evoke elemental from Lorwyn Eclipsed hit a Pro Tour high of over $34, buoyed by hype and Christoffer Larsen's winning decklist. But reality set in—supply is catching up, and the meta is adapting. With <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DTorpor%2520Orb" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/b/dbf02a38-d10d-463e-ab99-e7fd848a1bd3.jpg?1770090426" target="_blank">Torpor Orb</a> everywhere, Dimir Excruciator decks that rely on ETB triggers are struggling. Deceit slid to $22 and could go lower. It's still a Standard staple, but it's no longer the must-have four-of it was last month. If you bought at the peak, hold—it'll stabilize. If you're looking to buy, wait for the bottom.</p>

<h2>What This Means for Your Wallet and Deck</h2>
<p>The market is reacting to format shifts in real time. Lutri's spike shows Commander unbans still move money—always watch the RC's next moves. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DGilt-Leaf%2520Palace" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/c/c/cc4bbbb5-4218-4b2a-9ca2-de4d5f5dda19.jpg?1562368244" target="_blank">Gilt-Leaf Palace</a> proves that omission from a reprint set can trigger a collector frenzy. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DTorpor%2520Orb" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/b/dbf02a38-d10d-463e-ab99-e7fd848a1bd3.jpg?1770090426" target="_blank">Torpor Orb</a> reminds us that sideboard staples can rise quickly when the meta converges. And Deceit's cooling is a textbook case of a hype-driven correction.</p>

<p>If you're trading, sell high on Lutri foils and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DGilt-Leaf%2520Palace" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/c/c/cc4bbbb5-4218-4b2a-9ca2-de4d5f5dda19.jpg?1562368244" target="_blank">Gilt-Leaf Palace</a> now—they might peak. Buy <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DTorpor%2520Orb" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/b/dbf02a38-d10d-463e-ab99-e7fd848a1bd3.jpg?1770090426" target="_blank">Torpor Orb</a> before it climbs further. Wait on Deceit. And keep an eye on the next Legend rule change; if they partner more commanders, expect partner cards to spike.</p>

<h2>The Big Picture: Formats Are Shifting Fast</h2>
<p>Between the B&R update, the Pro Tour Richmond results, and the Lorwyn Eclipsed influx, Standard and Historic are in flux. Midrange decks with Sheoldred, the Apocalypse still dominate, but artifact-based hate like <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DTorpor%2520Orb" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/b/dbf02a38-d10d-463e-ab99-e7fd848a1bd3.jpg?1770090426" target="_blank">Torpor Orb</a> is gaining traction. Elfball is a real archetype, and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DGilt-Leaf%2520Palace" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/c/c/cc4bbbb5-4218-4b2a-9ca2-de4d5f5dda19.jpg?1562368244" target="_blank">Gilt-Leaf Palace</a> enables it. Chronicle of Victory makes tribal decks competitive again. Don't get attached to one deck—the meta is churning. Build flexible sideboards, keep dry-erase markers handy, and be ready to pivot.</p>

<p>That's the news this week. Lutri is the new Izzet darling, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DGilt-Leaf%2520Palace" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/c/c/cc4bbbb5-4218-4b2a-9ca2-de4d5f5dda19.jpg?1562368244" target="_blank">Gilt-Leaf Palace</a> is the land everyone wants, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DTorpor%2520Orb" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/b/dbf02a38-d10d-463e-ab99-e7fd848a1bd3.jpg?1770090426" target="_blank">Torpor Orb</a> is the sideboard card you need, and Deceit is finally cooling off. Play smart, trade smart, and I'll see you on the battlefield.</p>
<h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
<p>Commander queues just became a price-prediction market. Lutri at $72 signals blue-green decks will flood EDH pods, so [[<em>Veil of Summer]]]&nbsp;deputies spike as tech. Meanwhile, old-border [[<em>Gilt-Leaf Palaces]]] at $18 means Elfball decks add [[<em>Marwyn]]]&nbsp;plus [[<em>Llanowar Wastes]]], turning <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DTorpor%2520Orb" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/b/dbf02a38-d10d-463e-ab99-e7fd848a1bd3.jpg?1770090426" target="_blank">Torpor Orb</a> from meme to must-have. Your sideboard now reads: [[<em>Torpors]]]&nbsp;against ETB spammers, [[<em>Leyline of the Void]]]&nbsp;to keep Cub decks honest.</p>
<p>Halo-foil [[<em>Prophet of Kruphix]]]&nbsp;is the true litmus test—if it hits the commander list in July, expect another $50 tag on any foil; if not, the spike fades like [[<em>Bitterblossom]]]&nbsp;2022.  Speculate accordingly: buy Halo Lutris while they’re $72 or wait for the inevitable crash under $12.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Cards are cards, but the chase is now the game. Until the next quarterly announcement, every spoiler drop is a lottery ticket and every buy-list price is a lie.  Hold staples, dump hype spikes, and remember that in 2026, the real flex is a playset of [[<em>Alpha Islands]]]—price-stamped or not.</p>
