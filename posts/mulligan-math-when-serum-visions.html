</div>

<p>This is the modern mulligan dilemma. The London Mulligan rule changed everything. When you take a mulligan, you scry 1 after drawing your new hand. That tiny bit of selection turns what used to be a penalty into a tactical tool. Now, keeping a 6-card hand isn't just about "good enough" - it's about "can I leverage that scry to get where I need to be?"</p>

<h2>The New Keep Metrics</h2>

<p>Forget the old "7-card hand with 2-3 lands" rule. In London, your 6-card hand gets a quality filter. That means hands that were marginal keepers before are now often correct keeps. But not all sketchy sixes are created equal.</p>

<p>Ask yourself four questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Can I cast my spells on curve?</strong> If you need two lands to play your key cards, a 6-card hand better have two mana sources.</li>
<li><strong>Do I have a proactive plan?</strong> Are you the aggressor or the control? Aggro/combo decks need to curve out; control can afford to durdle a bit.</li>
<li><strong>Is my hand synergistic?</strong> A <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DNoble%2520Hierarch" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/0/400382a4-aea2-4827-b06a-1b0b3745908b.jpg?1758104002" target="_blank">Noble Hierarch</a> without a high-mana payoff is just a 0/1 that eats a Bolt.</li>
<li><strong>What does my scry target look like?</strong> If your deck has high land density and your hand is missing one specific piece, keep and scry for it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hands with <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DSerum%2520Visions" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/b/5b75eb6b-d76c-4b92-b042-13493f9ef164.jpg?1712354203" target="_blank">Serum Visions</a> are keep magnets for good reason. That card draws you two and scrys two. In a 6-card hand, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DSerum%2520Visions" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/b/5b75eb6b-d76c-4b92-b042-13493f9ef164.jpg?1712354203" target="_blank">Serum Visions</a> is half your selection package. It can smooth out a shaky mana base, find your missing threat, or dig past a brick.</p>

<p>Keep a 6 if you have: 1 land + <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DSerum%2520Visions" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/b/5b75eb6b-d76c-4b92-b042-13493f9ef164.jpg?1712354203" target="_blank">Serum Visions</a> + any other spell that's okay on one mana. The plan is: play land, cast Visions, see two cards, put one on bottom, draw a fresh one. That's card advantage and selection. You just went from 6 cards to effectively 8 quality cards.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DSerum%2520Visions" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/b/5b75eb6b-d76c-4b92-b042-13493f9ef164.jpg?1712354203" target="_blank">Serum Visions</a></em> in a 6-card hand is often correct even if the rest of the hand is mediocre because the card fixes so much. It's not just a cantrip - it's a London enabler.</p>

If you keep a 6-card hand with <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>, you'd better have a way to cast it on turn 1 (or turn 2 on the play without disruption). And you'd better have a follow-up play.</p>

<p>The trap: keeping a hand with <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>, two lands, and four other spells that all cost 3+ mana. You'll strip their best card on turn 1, but then you'll have nothing to play on turn 2. That's a losing play against most decks.</p>

<p>The keep: <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>, a one-drop creature (like Ragavan <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DNimble%2520Pilferer" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/7/0/706a38f3-8e7a-4ce5-9af9-e9f4c8afc9ec.jpg?1597377049" target="_blank">Nimble Pilferer</a>), and two lands. You take their removal, play Ragavan on turn 1, and steal their best non-land. That's a 2-for-1 and tempo swing. Now you're dictating the game.</p>

<p>These mana dorks are the backbone of many Modern and Legacy decks. But a hand with <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DNoble%2520Hierarch" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/0/400382a4-aea2-4827-b06a-1b0b3745908b.jpg?1758104002" target="_blank">Noble Hierarch</a> and three three-drops isn't automatically a keep in a 6-card hand. You need to ask: can I actually use the acceleration?</p>

<p>Keep if you have: <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DNoble%2520Hierarch" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/0/400382a4-aea2-4827-b06a-1b0b3745908b.jpg?1758104002" target="_blank">Noble Hierarch</a> + a 2-drop + a 3-drop. Turn 1 Hierarch, turn 2 your 2-drop, turn 3 your 3-drop. That's a perfect curve. That hand is gas.</p>

<p>Ship if you have: <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DNoble%2520Hierarch" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/0/400382a4-aea2-4827-b06a-1b0b3745908b.jpg?1758104002" target="_blank">Noble Hierarch</a> but your highest CMC is 3, and the rest are one-drops. You're not gaining much from the acceleration; you're just playing a 1/1 on turn 1. That's not worth the risk of not having enough mana to cast everything.</p>

<p><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DBirds%2520of%2520Paradise" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/3/d/3d69a3e0-6a2e-475a-964e-0affed1c017d.jpg?1722384747" target="_blank">Birds of Paradise</a> is even more punishing because it taps for any color. Keep with it if you have a high-mana payoff (like a 4-drop or a two-color spell). Otherwise, you're just playing a flying chump blocker.</p>

<h3><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DRagavan%252C%2520Nimble%2520Pilferer" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/a/9/a9738cda-adb1-47fb-9f4c-ecd930228c4d.jpg?1681963138" target="_blank">Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</a>: The Dash King</h3>

<p>Ragavan <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DNimble%2520Pilferer" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/7/0/706a38f3-8e7a-4ce5-9af9-e9f4c8afc9ec.jpg?1597377049" target="_blank">Nimble Pilferer</a> is format-warping. A turn 1 Ragavan often wins the game on its own. But in a 6-card hand, you have to consider the dash clause.</p>

<p>If your hand is just Ragavan and five other spells that cost 2+? Keep. You dash Ragavan on turn 1 for R, leaving you with a 5-card hand but an extra mana. That's fine. On turn 2 you can use Ragavan's ability to cast spells from the top of your library. You're still accessing those five cards, just with a timing delay.</p>

<p>The exception: if you have zero other one-drops and your deck relies on curving out perfectly, maybe ship. But Ragavan is so absurd that he often deserves the keep even on the draw.</p>

<h2>Archetype Matters</h2>

<p>Combo decks: You need the pieces. A 6-card hand with the two key combo cards and a tutor is a keep even if you're missing a third land. You'll scry for it.</p>

<p>Control decks: You want 3+ lands and a sweeper. A 6-card hand with 2 lands, a Counterspell, and a Sphinx's Revelation? Probably ship. But 3 lands, a draw spell, and a removal? That's fine.</p>

<p>Midrange decks: You want threat density. A hand with three creatures (<a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DNoble%2520Hierarch" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/0/400382a4-aea2-4827-b06a-1b0b3745908b.jpg?1758104002" target="_blank">Noble Hierarch</a>, Ragavan, something else) is keepable. You'll draw into your midrange haymakers.</p>

<h2>Your Mulligan Checklist</h2>

<p>Before you ship to five, run this mental script:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do I have at least two mana sources?</strong> (Three if you're playing a deck that wants to cast 3-drops on turn 2)</li>
<li><strong>Do I have a one-drop threat? </strong> (Ragavan, Goyf, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Do I have a two-mana play? </strong> (<a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>, Spell Pierce, a 2-drop creature)</li>
<li><strong>Is my hand cohesive? </strong> (Discard + creatures, ramp + payoff, draw spells + threats)</li>
<li><strong>If I keep, will my scry actually help? </strong> (If you're missing a specific card, scrying for it is good. If you're just missing lands in general, scrying won't fix it.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you answered "yes" to three or more, keep. If not, ship.</p>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>

<p>London Mulligan turned mulligans from a tax into a tool. That 6-card hand with <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DSerum%2520Visions" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/b/5b75eb6b-d76c-4b92-b042-13493f9ef164.jpg?1712354203" target="_blank">Serum Visions</a>? It might just be the right keep. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a> in hand? That's interactive magic. Ragavan? Dash him out and feel good about it.</p>

<p>But remember: your deck's plan matters more than any single rule. Playtest. Watch matches. Develop a feel for what your 6-card hands actually do. And next time you're agonizing at the table, just remember: you get a scry. Use it.</p>
