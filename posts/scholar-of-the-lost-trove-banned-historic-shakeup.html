<h2>The Combo Decks Got Nuked</h2><p><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DScholar%2520of%2520the%2520Lost%2520Trove" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/a/a/aa254a86-3c30-408d-9c14-befd472f9740.jpg?1770635117" target="_blank">Scholar of the Lost Trove</a> is banned. That's the engine of the infamous Scholar Combo deck that's been warping Historic for over a year. The deck could chain together tutors and win the game out of nowhere, often on turn 4 or 5, with zero interaction. It was the epitome of non-interactive Magic — you either had the one-card answer or you lost. Good riddance. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DEldrazi%2520Temple" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/c/b/cbab7e1f-305e-4733-aa70-b27285740925.jpg?1690006046" target="_blank">Eldrazi Temple</a> is also gone, which slaughters the Eldrazi ramp decks that could slam threats like Ulamog, Ceaseless Hunger well ahead of curve. Those decks were so linear they might as well have been playing solitaire. Wizards finally listened and pulled the plug.</p><p>But wait — there's more. Ajani Nacatl Pariah is banned too, which hits cat tribal hard. Crop Rotation also gets the axe, which might seem minor but actually hurts ramp strategies and toolbox decks. Four bans in one day? That's unprecedented for Historic. This isn't a tweak; it's a full-scale purge of the most oppressive archetypes.</p><h2>The Unban Wave: Old Gems Return</h2><p>While the bans are dramatic, the unbans are equally interesting. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DMagus%2520of%2520the%2520Moon" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/7/c/7c9bd75c-9606-4607-bfa6-d6acdee12820.jpg?1619397276" target="_blank">Magus of the Moon</a> is back — that card is a house. It's a 2/2 for {1}{R} that turns all nonbasic lands into Mountains. In a format full of greedy manabases, this card is absolute gas. You slam it turn 2 against a three-color control deck and watch them brick on their colored mana for the next three turns. It's a punishing card that rewards aggro players who want to keep the tempo.</p><p>Harbinger of the Seas is also unbanned. That 2-mana 1/3 flyer mills two cards whenever it attacks, and grants islandwalk to all your creatures as long as it's on the battlefield. It's perfect for mono-blue tempo decks.</p><p>Force of Vigor and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DForce%2520of%2520Negation" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/1/8/1825a719-1b2a-4af9-9cd2-7cb497cd0317.jpg?1764119635" target="_blank">Force of Negation</a> returning is huge — each is one of the best interaction spells ever printed. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DForce%2520of%2520Negation" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/1/8/1825a719-1b2a-4af9-9cd2-7cb497cd0317.jpg?1764119635" target="_blank">Force of Negation</a> gives blue decks a cheap counter, while Force of Vigor provides green with efficient creature and permanent removal. Having them back expands the options for control and midrange decks without relying on clunky, high-cost answers.</p><p>Endurance is unbanned too, a 2-mana 1/4 that can't be blocked. When it enters, exile a card from an opponent's graveyard. Whenever a card goes to an opponent's graveyard, you may give Endurance +1/+1. It's a powerful graveyard hate piece that also works in graveyard-centric strategies.</p><p><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DWilderness%2520Reclamation" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/e/5e6c0cb4-f17d-48ae-9bbf-9498505a23b0.jpg?1726285155" target="_blank">Wilderness Reclamation</a> is back — oh boy. That card untaps all your lands when you cast instant spells. Combined with big mana or combo potential, it's a recipe for disaster. But it also enables fair decks to generate insane amounts of mana. Agent of Treachery returns as a top-tier creature that steals anything and can go infinite with certain combos. This is a serious power-level bump for the format.</p><h2>What Decks Actually Die</h2><p>Scholar Combo is dead. That deck relied on <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DScholar%2520of%2520the%2520Lost%2520Trove" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/a/a/aa254a86-3c30-408d-9c14-befd472f9740.jpg?1770635117" target="_blank">Scholar of the Lost Trove</a> to fetch Tormenting Voice or other discard outlets, then chain into a win. Without the engine, the deck can't function. Goodbye.</p><p><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DEldrazi%2520Temple" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/c/b/cbab7e1f-305e-4733-aa70-b27285740925.jpg?1690006046" target="_blank">Eldrazi Temple</a> decks also get murdered. Temple into Matter Reshaper into an early Ulamog was just broken. The deck was so consistent it felt like cheating. Now those decks have to play fair ramp, which is much slower.</p><p>Cat tribal with Ajani Nacatl Pariah was a tier 2 deck that got a big boost when the cat dropped a 2/2 whenever you cast another cat. That synergy is gone, so cat decks go back to being jank.</p><h2>The New Format Staples</h2><p><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DMagus%2520of%2520the%2520Moon" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/7/c/7c9bd75c-9606-4607-bfa6-d6acdee12820.jpg?1619397276" target="_blank">Magus of the Moon</a> immediately becomes a format staple in any aggressive red deck. It hoses greedy manabases and can close games fast. Expect to see it in everything from mono-red goblins to burn decks.</p><p><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DForce%2520of%2520Negation" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/1/8/1825a719-1b2a-4af9-9cd2-7cb497cd0317.jpg?1764119635" target="_blank">Force of Negation</a> and Force of Vigor are both top-tier interaction. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DForce%2520of%2520Negation" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/1/8/1825a719-1b2a-4af9-9cd2-7cb497cd0317.jpg?1764119635" target="_blank">Force of Negation</a> is a cheap counter for blue decks, while Force of Vigor destroys big threats efficiently. These spells are insanely good in control and midrange decks that need to protect their game plan.</p><p><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DWilderness%2520Reclamation" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/e/5e6c0cb4-f17d-48ae-9bbf-9498505a23b0.jpg?1726285155" target="_blank">Wilderness Reclamation</a> is potentially the most broken unbanned card. Imagine playing a ramp deck, dropping Reclamation, then casting a big draw spell or a finisher with the mana you just generated. It goes wide with cards like Growth Spiral. This could enable some serious explosive turns.</p><p>Agent of Treachery is a 3/3 flyer that steals a creature or planeswalker. It's a house in control mirrors and goes infinite with certain combos. It's going to see play everywhere.</p><h2>The Meta Shift</h2><p>The message is clear: Wizards is done with non-interactive combo decks in Historic. Scholar Combo and Eldrazi ramp were killing diversity. Now we're back to fair Magic — creatures attacking, spells resolving, players actually responding to each other. The unbans reintroduce powerful but fair tools that make the game more skill-intensive. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DMagus%2520of%2520the%2520Moon" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/7/c/7c9bd75c-9606-4607-bfa6-d6acdee12820.jpg?1619397276" target="_blank">Magus of the Moon</a> asks both players to play around it. Force spells give control decks actual answers.</p><p>But beware: <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DWilderness%2520Reclamation" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/5/e/5e6c0cb4-f17d-48ae-9bbf-9498505a23b0.jpg?1726285155" target="_blank">Wilderness Reclamation</a> might create its own broken deck. Ramp decks can go off with it and a draw spell. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a new combo deck emerge around it. Still, it's better than the old nonsense.</p><h2>What Should You Build?</h2><p>If you love aggressive decks, build mono-red with <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DMagus%2520of%2520the%2520Moon" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/7/c/7c9bd75c-9606-4607-bfa6-d6acdee12820.jpg?1619397276" target="_blank">Magus of the Moon</a>. If you're a control player, jam <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DForce%2520of%2520Negation" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/1/8/1825a719-1b2a-4af9-9cd2-7cb497cd0317.jpg?1764119635" target="_blank">Force of Negation</a> and Agent of Treachery. If you enjoy midrange, pick up Endurance and Harbinger of the Seas. The format just got a massive shakeup, and the old guard is gone. This is the perfect time to experiment.</p><p>The Arena ladder is going to feel completely different in a week. Get ahead of the curve now while everyone else is still salty about their banned decks. Crack some packs, find the new broken synergy, and climb. History just got rewritten.</p>
