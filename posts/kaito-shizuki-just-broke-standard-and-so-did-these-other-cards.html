This isn't just another planeswalker-this is the kind of card that makes you question whether Wizards has completely lost the plot. At three mana for a 3/3 with upside, Kaito curves out into the most insane value engine we've seen in years. Turn 3 you slam this, turn 4 you're drawing cards, making tokens, and your opponent is just... dead.</p>

</div><h3><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DKaito%2520Shizuki" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/2/d/2d35a710-3008-4e27-8afd-6e83329f9917.jpg?1654568510" target="_blank">Kaito Shizuki</a>: The Format-Warping Beast</h3><p>Why is this card so nuts? At 1U (that's one blue and one colorless), you get a 3/3 creature with defender that enters with two +1/+1 counters. But the real magic is in his activated abilities: you can remove a counter to draw a card, and you can remove a counter to create a 1/1 blue Ninja creature token. That's not even counting his +1 ability that scries 2 and gives him a shield counter until your next turn.</p><p>What this means in practice is insane threat density. On the play, turn 2 you can play a land and pass. Turn 3 you drop Kaito. Turn 4 you're already drawing extra cards and making tokens. Your opponent needs to answer this immediately or they're behind on board and cards. And Kaito's stats are solid-a 3/3 for three mana is already above rate, but the abilities make it completely broken.</p><p>In Limited, this is an automatic first-pick bomb. In Standard? Every blue deck will be playing four copies. This card single-handedly makes Azorious and Dimir control decks terrifyingly consistent. It also enables some hilarious combos with cards that care about creatures entering the battlefield. Boseiju Who Endures is going to have a field day with this guy.</p><h3>Boseiju Who Endures: The Land That Shouldn't Exist</h3><p>Okay, let's talk about the card that has everyone screaming. Boseiju Who Endures is a land. Yes, you read that right. A land that lets you pay 2 life and sacrifice it to destroy target permanent. That's it. That's the whole card. And it's completely bonkers.</p><p>Think about this for a second. In a format full of big mana dorks and value engines, a free, sacrificeable land that can answer any threat is absurd. This isn't a "sometimes" card-this is always an answer. Your opponent drops Ugin, the Ineffable? Sacrifice Boseiju and watch them cry. They have a planeswalker that's about to ultimate? Gone. A creature that's about to kill you? Bye-bye.</p><p>The downside of paying 2 life is completely negligible in most matchups. And because it's a land, you can play it whenever you want. No colored mana requirement, no timing restrictions. This is the kind of card that makes control decks oppressive and aggro decks miserable. If you're not playing Boseiju in every non-rotating format that can support it, you're doing it wrong.</p><h3>Otawara Soaring City: The New Domain Hub</h3><p>Otawara Soaring City enters the party as a five-color land that can tap for any color. But here's the twist: it comes in with a flying 1/1 spirit token. That's actually relevant! In a format moving toward domain strategies, this card provides both fixing and a body. The token can block, attack, and trigger any "creature enters" abilities you have.</p><p>What I love about Otawara is that it doesn't have the typical downside of coming into play tapped (it doesn't-it's untapped). The spirit token is just gravy. This makes five-color decks much more viable, especially with cards like <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DKaito%2520Shizuki" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/2/d/2d35a710-3008-4e27-8afd-6e83329f9917.jpg?1654568510" target="_blank">Kaito Shizuki</a> that want colored mana but don't specify colors. I'm already dreaming of a five-color soup deck that curves from Boseiju into Kaito into Otawara into some big finisher.</p><h3>The Reality Chip: Equipment That Actually Works</h3><p>Equipment that draws cards? Yes, please. The Reality Chip is an equipment that, when equipped, gives the creature +2/+0 and flying. More importantly, whenever equipped creature attacks, you may cast a nonland card with converted mana cost 2 or less from the top of your library without paying its mana cost. That's gas.</p><p>Imagine turn 2 attaching this to a cheap creature. Turn 3 you attack, cast something for free, and then you can attack again with that new creature if it has power. This creates insane tempo swings. The Reality Chip turns any mediocre creature into a threat that pulls double duty. In aggressive decks that run lots of low-CMC spells, this is going to be a megaton bomb.</p><p>I'm not sold on it in control decks yet, but in any midrange or aggro shell that cares about cheap spells, this is probably a four-of. The fact that it's an Equipment also means you can move it around if your equipped creature gets killed. That flexibility is huge.</p><h3>Lion Sash: The Attrition King</h3><p>Enchantments that can attack? Yes, Lion Sash can become a creature and attack. For 2W, you get an enchantment that says "Whenever you create a token, put a +1/+1 counter on Lion Sash." Then you can tap it to deal damage equal to its power to any target. That's some serious upside in token decks.</p><p>What I love about Lion Sash is that it's a card that rewards you for doing what you already want to do. If you're playing a deck that makes a lot of tokens (hello, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DKaito%2520Shizuki" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/2/d/2d35a710-3008-4e27-8afd-6e83329f9917.jpg?1654568510" target="_blank">Kaito Shizuki</a>), this just gets online immediately. A 2/2 for 3 that can grow and become a recurring threat is no joke. In a format where we're seeing more token strategies, Lion Sash is going to be a house.</p><p>The fact that it's an enchantment also means it dodges a lot of removal that hits creatures. And that activated ability is no joke-once Lion Sash gets to 4-5 power, it can just close out games on its own. I'm high on this card in both Limited and Standard.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>These Kamigawa Neon Dynasty sequel spoilers are not messing around. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DKaito%2520Shizuki" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/2/d/2d35a710-3008-4e27-8afd-6e83329f9917.jpg?1654568510" target="_blank">Kaito Shizuki</a> is a format-defining planeswalker, Boseiju Who Endures is the most pushed land ever printed, and the others are all strong playables that will slot into multiple archetypes. If you're looking to build a competitive deck when this set drops, start foiling out your <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DKaito%2520Shizuki" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/2/d/2d35a710-3008-4e27-8afd-6e83329f9917.jpg?1654568510" target="_blank">Kaito Shizuki</a> playset now.</p><p>The power level is high, which means we're in for some wild Standard seasons. But honestly? I'm here for it. Magic is more fun when cards are pushed and we have to figure out how to break them. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go test a four-color Kaito deck with Boseiju and Otawara.</p>
