You want to cast it when your opponent is hellbent and you've got backup. If you slam it on curve into an empty board, they just wrath you and you're left holding two mana worth of cards. That's not tempo—that's suicide.</p><h2>Dragon Rage Channeler: The Real MVP</h2><p>Dragon Rage Channeler is the card that makes the deck hum. On turn 2, you're not looking to cast Murktide; you're looking to get Channeler online. A turn 2 Channeler into a Bauble or <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DExpressive%2520Iteration" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/5/45e92d69-0684-4a57-8c1c-bbf742bd8a23.jpg?1743207125" target="_blank">Expressive Iteration</a> is the nuts. It forces your opponent to use their removal before they've developed, or they eat a 4/4 flying dragon on turn 3. That's tempo. That's pressure.</p><p>When you have both Murktide and Channeler in hand, you need to ask: what's the play? If your opponent is on a slow deck, get Channeler down first. If they're on Burn, maybe you need Murktide to block. But the sequence that wins more games is Channeler on 2, Murktide on 3 with a <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DCounterspell" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/f/4f616706-ec97-4923-bb1e-11a69fbaa1f8.jpg?1751282477" target="_blank">counterspell</a> backup.

You're not running <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DCounterspell" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/f/4f616706-ec97-4923-bb1e-11a69fbaa1f8.jpg?1751282477" target="_blank">Counterspell</a> to protect your guys—well, sometimes you are—but mostly you're using it to protect your tempo.

If you're at 5 mana and you have Murktide plus <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DCounterspell" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/f/4f616706-ec97-4923-bb1e-11a69fbaa1f8.jpg?1751282477" target="_blank">Counterspell</a> in hand, don't cast the Murktide yet. Wait. Let them try to remove it, then counter and slam it end of turn. That's the kind of play that makes your opponent squirm.</p><h3>Bauble and Iteration: Card Selection is Tempo</h3><p>Mishra Bauble and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DExpressive%2520Iteration" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/5/45e92d69-0684-4a57-8c1c-bbf742bd8a23.jpg?1743207125" target="_blank">Expressive Iteration</a> are the engines that find your pieces without costing you tempo. You're not "losing" a turn to draw; you're setting up. Bauble on turn 1 lets you see three cards and shuffle away the junk. That's huge.</p><p><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DExpressive%2520Iteration" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/5/45e92d69-0684-4a57-8c1c-bbf742bd8a23.jpg?1743207125" target="_blank">Expressive Iteration</a> on turn 2 or 3 often looks like you're falling behind, but it digs two deep and gives you an extra land drop if you need it. The fact that it's an instant means you can cast it on your opponent's end step, preserving your own tempo for a big turn. That's the secret: you don't always need to be the fastest deck. You just need to be faster when it counts.</p><h2>Common Sequencing Blunders That Lose Games</h2><p><strong>Bricking on too many Murktides:</strong> Two Murktides in hand? That's not gas; that's a liability. You often want to discard one to an <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DExpressive%2520Iteration" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/5/45e92d69-0684-4a57-8c1c-bbf742bd8a23.jpg?1743207125" target="_blank">Expressive Iteration</a> or just hold it and use the other to kill something.</p><p><strong>Missing the Island:</strong> Murktide wants to cast instants and sorceries. If you've got three Mountains and one Island, you're probably not casting <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DCounterspell" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/f/4f616706-ec97-4923-bb1e-11a69fbaa1f8.jpg?1751282477" target="_blank">Counterspell</a> on their turn. Mana weave is a real thing—make sure you have blue sources.</p><p><strong>Channeler into topdeck:</strong> Casting Channeler on turn 2 feels great, but if you don't have any spells in hand, you're just praying to topdeck. Keep enough gas that Channeler actually draws you a card. One spell in hand isn't enough—you need at least two or three to make it worthwhile.</p><h2>The Nuts: When It All Clicks</h2><p>There's a turn that makes all this worthwhile. Turn 1: Mishra Bauble, crack it, see an Island. Turn 2: Cast Dragon Rage Channeler. They play a creature. Turn 3: You slam <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DMurktide%2520Regent" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/2/0/20c4aae1-7665-4df7-bd51-a1d95bf8a17d.jpg?1626094651" target="_blank">Murktide Regent</a> end of turn, hold up <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DCounterspell" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/f/4f616706-ec97-4923-bb1e-11a69fbaa1f8.jpg?1751282477" target="_blank">Counterspell</a>. On their turn, they try to kill something, you counter. On your turn, you swing with a 4/4 flier and they're down to 12. That's the tempo puzzle solved: you're advancing your board, answering theirs, and applying pressure all at once. That's when you know you've got it.</p>
<h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
<p>This deck is velocity math: each cantrip plus Force is a two-mana advantage wrapped in tempo.  The critical number is **2.5**—that’s the total instants/sorcs in the graveyard needed to cast the first lethal Murktide.  Track every Bauble, Iteration, or fetchland activation like you’re running a stock ticker.  Mis-count and you’re slapping a 2/2 flyer into [[<em>Swords to Plowshares]]]&nbsp;while the opponent curves out; count right and a 6/6 dragon plus [[<em><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DCounterspell" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/f/4f616706-ec97-4923-bb1e-11a69fbaa1f8.jpg?1751282477" target="_blank">Counterspell</a>]]]&nbsp;safety nets you the game on turn-four.</p>
<p>The sideboard swap proves the deck’s reach: cut [[<em>Subtlety]]]&nbsp;for [[<em>Spell Pierce]]]&nbsp;against combo and suddenly the deck becomes two-mana faster while still holding two free counters.  Graveyard hate like [[<em>Relic of Progenitus]]]&nbsp;isn’t enough; opponents need a [[<em>Hurkyl’s Recall]]] plus removal plan, and even that folds to <em>force-counter-recursion loops</em>.  Every game becomes how much virtual mana tempo you can bank before your dragon attacks twice.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Watch [[<em>Modern Horizons 3]]]&nbsp;previews like a hawk—any 0-1 mana blue cantrip with upside pushes the deck from tier-one to format tyrant.  If [[<em>Narset, Parter of Veils]]]&nbsp;gets re-legal, we’ll see a full four-of [[<em>Force]]] plus [[<em>Jace, the Mind Sculptor]]] combo shell that bricks mid-range opponents in two turns.  For now, slam Murktide on curve, count the .5 spells, and ride the free <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DCounterspell" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/4/f/4f616706-ec97-4923-bb1e-11a69fbaa1f8.jpg?1751282477" target="_blank">counterspell</a> wave until the banhammer inevitably says “no more.”  Mid-range got its lightning bolt; ride it or fold.</p>
