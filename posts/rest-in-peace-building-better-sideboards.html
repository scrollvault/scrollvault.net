</div><p>Blank stare.</p><p>Here's the brutal truth: you can curve out perfectly, have all the gas you need, but if you bring in the wrong fifteen cards post-board, you'll lose matches you should have won. Your sideboard doesn't just "tweak" your deck-it transforms it. It's the reason you beat the mirror. It's how you hate out your opponent's entire strategy.</p><p>Today we're building better sideboards, using a framework that actually works. I'm talking about cards like <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DRest%2520in%2520Peace" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/1/d108c2b1-236e-4b8d-8445-d9749ccc4fea.jpg?1739804156" target="_blank">Rest in Peace</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DMystical%2520Dispute" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/f/b/fbe04cb8-a8b9-4241-baae-b398a2509a3a.jpg?1572489956" target="_blank">Mystical Dispute</a></strong>, <strong>Negate</strong>, <strong>Duress</strong>, and <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DUnlicensed%2520Hearse" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/9/3/93ee60f7-31dd-4bc6-b71f-57a1a0d19d20.jpg?1664414360" target="_blank">Unlicensed Hearse</a></strong>.

That's a 6-0 on the play against any graveyard deck. They can't operate. They can't kill you. They're playing vanilla creatures while you're deploying real threats.</p><p>The card is nuts because it doesn't just "hate" on graveyards-it annihilates them. It's proactive. It's cheap. Most importantly, it's a complete program that changes how your opponent plays the game.

But the real kicker: if you're countering a blue spell, it costs {U}{U} instead of {2}{U}{U}. That's the difference between "I can't cast this" and "I just countered your Teferi's Protection."</p><p>In a world of Chord of Calling, Collected Company, and all the green four-mana do-everything creatures? <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DMystical%2520Dispute" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/f/b/fbe04cb8-a8b9-4241-baae-b398a2509a3a.jpg?1572489956" target="_blank">Mystical Dispute</a></strong> is your answer. In a control mirror where somebody's going to resolve a planeswalker? This is the card that says "nope."</p><p>I see too many sideboards running three <strong>Negate</strong> and one <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DMystical%2520Dispute" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/f/b/fbe04cb8-a8b9-4241-baae-b398a2509a3a.jpg?1572489956" target="_blank">Mystical Dispute</a></strong>. That's backwards. You want four <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DMystical%2520Dispute" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/f/b/fbe04cb8-a8b9-4241-baae-b398a2509a3a.jpg?1572489956" target="_blank">Mystical Dispute</a></strong> and three <strong>Negate</strong>. The discount clause is that good.</p><h2>Negate and Duress: The Duo That Never Sleeps</h2><p>These two are the bread and butter of any control or midrange sideboard. <strong>Negate</strong> handles non-creature spells. <strong>Duress</strong> handles everything else-well, everything in the hand anyway.</p><p>You're not bringing these in against aggro. You're bringing them in against combo, control, and any deck that relies on key pieces resolving. Turn 2 Duress their Serum Visions? That's information and tempo. Turn 3 Negate theirAdNauseam? That's a game win.</p><p>The key is that they're cheap. Two mana for either effect is highway robbery. You can curve these out with your other spells and actually develop your board while disrupting theirs.</p><p>I've seen people cut these in the face of creature-based decks. That's wrong. You need them for the non-creature-based decks that will otherwise run you over. The metagame isn't just go-wide aggro-it's also ramp players casting Storm the Festival and combo decks trying to assemble their pieces.</p><h2><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DUnlicensed%2520Hearse" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/9/3/93ee60f7-31dd-4bc6-b71f-57a1a0d19d20.jpg?1664414360" target="_blank">Unlicensed Hearse</a>: The Card Advantage Engine</h2><p>If you're in black and you're not playing <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DUnlicensed%2520Hearse" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/9/3/93ee60f7-31dd-4bc6-b71f-57a1a0d19d20.jpg?1664414360" target="_blank">Unlicensed Hearse</a></strong>, explain yourself.</p><p>Two mana, artifact, you can tap it to exile a card from any graveyard-and you get a +1/+1 counter.

You've already got a 2/2. Turn 2, exile their Elvish Reclaimer. Turn 3, it's a 3/3. By turn 5, it's a 5/5 that's been eating their graveyard all game.</p><p>The card is especially brutal in grindy matchups where you need a clock. It's a creature that dodges most removal (it's an artifact until it's turned on), it's card advantage (you're stripping their resources), and it's a win condition. I'm not sold on these "graveyard hate" creatures that don't actually impact the board-<strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DUnlicensed%2520Hearse" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/9/3/93ee60f7-31dd-4bc6-b71f-57a1a0d19d20.jpg?1664414360" target="_blank">Unlicensed Hearse</a></strong> does it all.</p><h2>Building the Complete 15</h2><p>So how do you actually construct your fifteen sideboard cards?</p><p>First, identify the five decks you actually can't beat with your maindeck. That's your starting point. If you keep losing to Burn, bring in your lifegain and damage prevention. If you lose to Tron, bring in the land destruction. If you lose to combo, bring in the instant-speed disruption.</p><p>Second, play to your deck's strengths. If you're a control deck, bring in more <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DCounters" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/0/4/0411ae1f-a1f8-4e64-8cdd-96b8350db1b2.jpg?1755269419" target="_blank">counters</a> and removal. If you're an aggro deck, bring in hate cards that don't slow you down. If you're a midrange deck, bring in cards that grind better than your opponent.</p><p>Third, don't just bring in cards willy-nilly-test them. Track your matchups. Which sideboard cards actually change the outcome? Which ones sit in your hand dead? If a card is dead more than 20% of the time, cut it.</p><p>My rule of thumb: 4 cards that hose the field's best deck, 4 cards that help your worst matchup, 3 cards that improve your mirror, and 4 flex slots based on the metagame you expect.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Your sideboard should feel as deliberate as your maindeck. It's not a collection of "maybe good" cards-it's your surgical kit.</p><p><strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DRest%2520in%2520Peace" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/d/1/d108c2b1-236e-4b8d-8445-d9749ccc4fea.jpg?1739804156" target="_blank">Rest in Peace</a></strong> for graveyard decks. <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DMystical%2520Dispute" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/f/b/fbe04cb8-a8b9-4241-baae-b398a2509a3a.jpg?1572489956" target="_blank">Mystical Dispute</a></strong> for blue spells. <strong>Negate</strong> for anything else non-creature. <strong>Duress</strong> for stripping their hand. <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DUnlicensed%2520Hearse" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/9/3/93ee60f7-31dd-4bc6-b71f-57a1a0d19d20.jpg?1664414360" target="_blank">Unlicensed Hearse</a></strong> for a threat that also disrupts.</p><p>Build with purpose.
