<h2>The Best Deck in Pioneer Right Now</h2>
<p>Let's cut the crap. Golgari Midrange isn't just good-it's oppressive. While other format staples rise and fall, this deck just keeps grinding wins. The core is disgustingly simple: resolve <strong>Sheoldred the Apocalypse</strong> and <strong>Graveyard Trespasser</strong>, then watch your opponent's life total evaporate. Everything else is just support to make that happen more often.</p>

<p>The beauty is in the redundancy. Sheoldred demands an answer immediately or you lose on the spot. Trespasser dives into your graveyard and out-Value any fair creature. Between these two, you have more maindeck threats than most decks can handle. I've been playing it for weeks and still get blown out by how consistent this deck is-it curves out, it goes wide, it has answers, and it just doesn't care about your "fair" plan.</p>

<h3>The Discard Package: Mental Pressure</h3>
<p>Four <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a></strong> is non-negotiable. Nothing says "you can't kill me" like ripping their combo piece on turn 1. Pair that with some <strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DFatal%2520Push" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/6/e/6e9d8fe4-fd9b-4923-92bf-7dd6b8fa02e7.jpg?1598304715" target="_blank">Fatal Push</a></strong> to clean up early threats and you've got a discard suite that keeps you alive until your bombs resolve. This is classic Golgari: make them discard the answer, then deploy your threat.</p>

<p>I'm running three <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DFatal%2520Push" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/6/e/6e9d8fe4-fd9b-4923-92bf-7dd6b8fa02e7.jpg?1598304715" target="_blank">Fatal Push</a> mainboard right now-the format is full of small creatures and the artifact hate in the sideboard can always board in more. Push into Sheoldred's deathtouch prowess? Yes please. This deck gasps at the thought of being "fair."</p>

<h3>The Queen Herself</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DVraska%252C%2520Golgari%2520Queen" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/a/3/a36d3ea7-0f18-4865-b47b-755673db065e.jpg?1572893904" target="_blank">Vraska, Golgari Queen</a></strong> is your planeswalker of choice, and honestly she's perfect here. She answers resolved threats (+1 to destroy), she draws cards (+1 to scry), and her ultimate is actually killable but still back-breaking. Vraska stabilizes boards that would otherwise run you over, and she does it on a curve that makes sense: turn 4 she comes down, turn 5 you're already threatening lethal with Trespasser.</p>

<p>Don't underestimate how much creature removal you need. I run two Vraskas main and one in the board. She's your out when they have a monster you can't beat. She's also just a house in grindy matchups where she can tick up and answer multiple threats per turn. The Golgari Queen isn't flashy, but she wins games you have no right winning.</p>

<h2>The Full Decklist</h2>
<p>This is my current 75 after a weekend of results and adjustments. It's tuned for a meta full of UW Control, Mono Red, and random aggro decks that think they have a chance:</p>

<pre>
4 Sheoldred the Apocalypse
4 Graveyard Trespasser
4 Thoughtseize
4 Fatal Push
3 Vraska, Golgari Queen
2 Noxious Grasp
2 Heartless Act
2 Sword of Feast and Famine
2 Lich's Mastery
2 Agadeem's Awakening
2 Forest
2 Swamp

<p>Manabase is simple-you want to cast Sheoldred on turn 4 reliably. That means basics and basics and maybe some utility lands later. I keep it lean because this deck curves hard and needs to deploy threats on time.</p>

<h3>Sideboarding Strategy</h3>
<p>Bring in more removal against fast decks. <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DNoxious%2520Grasp" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/8/e/8e5758cc-1f84-455d-a983-8ec471727eaf.jpg?1592516744" target="_blank">Noxious Grasp</a> shines here. Against control, you want the <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DLich's%2520Mastery" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/7/7/77f4c9cb-f364-4556-8673-4b19d52a2cff.jpg?1562738043" target="_blank">Lich's Mastery</a>-it's your "win the game after they board wipe" card. Against midrange mirrors, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DHeartless%2520Act" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/5/b57c57a8-d72b-4c6c-a2db-a7ef61190f42.jpg?1764120715" target="_blank">Heartless Act</a> is your trump card for their big threats. And always, always bring in some artifact hate. Mono Red and UW both play key artifacts, and you have the tools to answer them.</p>

<p>I'm also testing one Reclamation Sage in the board-it's a "I win" against control manabases that stabilize with Azorius. You just drop it, blow up their land, and they can't recover.</p>

<h2>How to Actually Play This Thing</h2>
<p>Turn 1: <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>. Always. Unless you have the nuts Sheoldred draw, take their best card-the removal spell, the counter, the combo piece. Make them regret their mulligan.</p>

<p>Turn 2: Trespasser if you can cast it. If not, hold up Push. You're not trying to be cute. You're trying to not die.</p>

<p>Turn 3: This is your critical turn. If you have Sheoldred, slam it. If you have Trespasser and a graveyard filler, that's fine too. The key is to establish a threat that demands an answer. Don't hold back-this deck wants to apply pressure early.</p>

<p>Turn 4: Vraska time. Or another Sheoldred. Or a second Trespasser with some新模式.</p>

The deck plays itself once you understand the pattern: discard, deploy, answer, repeat. If you top-deck gas, you're probably already ahead. If you brick, well, that's Pioneer-you can't win them all.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Golgari Midrange is the new deck to beat. It's not flashy like some combo deck, but it's brutally effective. Sheoldred the Apocalypse might be the most powerful mythic in Pioneer right now-the card is just unfair when you can cast it on curve.</p>

<p>If you're not playing this, you're falling behind. The format has shifted, and Golgari sits at the top. Go build it, play it, and thank me later when you're grinding out wins at your LGS.</p>

<h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
<p>Sheoldred turns Pioneer mid-range into a true four-turn clock: T2 [[<em>Trespasser]]]&nbsp;drain 2, T3 [[<em>Vraska]]]&nbsp;kill plus draw, T4 [[<em>Sheoldred]]]&nbsp;= 15 life swing and an opponent top-decking. Every discard piece is free value: [[<em><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/gRPPm5?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fsearch%2Fmagic%2Fproduct%3Fq%3DThoughtseize" rel="nofollow sponsored" class="card-ref" data-img="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/b/2/b281a308-ab6b-47b6-bec7-632c9aaecede.jpg?1599706001" target="_blank">Thoughtseize</a>]]]&nbsp;plus [[<em>Sheoldred]]]&nbsp;turn-three reads “remove or die.”</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Players pre-board [[<em>Leyline of the Void]]]&nbsp;to keep yard clear; [[<em>Sheoldred]]]&nbsp;will still rule until [[<em>Farewell]]]&nbsp;or [[<em>Settle the Wreckage]]]&nbsp;drops—until then, curve 2-3-6 and watch the opponent fold.</p>
