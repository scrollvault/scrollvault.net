# Daily Log — 2026-02-14

## Morning Scout Run
- Discovered TMNT bundle delay (North America) and preview schedule including "Turtle Team-Up" cooperative mode.
- Output to JSON (2 stories). Both high relevance.
- No major tournament results or banlist updates past 48h.

## Day Work
- Reviewed user feedback on hero images; implemented improvements:
  - News posts without decklist: no hero card (gradient instead)
  - Basic lands filtered from hero selection
  - Featured-cards injection disabled for News
- Rebuilt site; committed on master.
- Fixed footer consistency across all deck pages (46 files).
- Created hub pages and trust pages; merged to master.
- Addressed "header not permanent" issue by ensuring all pages use shared footer template.

## Plans
- Continue hub content expansion.
- Monitor weekly land verification cron.

## Evening Session — Config Recovery & Automation
- Discovered agent definitions missing after partial config patches; only `automation` remained.
- Root cause: earlier `config.patch` calls overwrote `agents.list` instead of merging.
- Fix: Rebuilt full agent suite via single `config.patch` with complete list:
  - scout, writer, editor, factchecker, publisher, designer, qa, automation.
- Model routing: scout/factchecker → hermes4:405b (strongest); automation → step; publisher → coder.
- Subagent allowlists added to enable pipeline collaboration.
- Verified cron jobs: weekly land verification (Sun 3 AM UTC), daily pipeline (6 AM ET), morning digest (8 AM ET).
- Health check clean; all agents registered and operational.
- Next: optionally trigger a manual pipeline run to validate before first 6 AM execution.
