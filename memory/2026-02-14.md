# Daily Log — 2026-02-14

## Morning Scout Run
- Discovered TMNT bundle delay (North America) and preview schedule including "Turtle Team-Up" cooperative mode.
- Output to JSON (2 stories). Both high relevance.
- No major tournament results or banlist updates past 48h.

## Day Work
- Reviewed user feedback on hero images; implemented improvements:
  - News posts without decklist: no hero card (gradient instead)
  - Basic lands filtered from hero selection
  - Featured-cards injection disabled for News
- Rebuilt site; committed on master.
- Fixed footer consistency across all deck pages (46 files).
- Created hub pages and trust pages; merged to master.
- Addressed "header not permanent" issue by ensuring all pages use shared footer template.

## Plans
- Continue hub content expansion.
- Monitor weekly land verification cron.
