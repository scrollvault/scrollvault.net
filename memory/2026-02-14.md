# Daily Log — 2026-02-14

## Morning Scout Run
- Discovered TMNT bundle delay (North America) and preview schedule including "Turtle Team-Up" cooperative mode.
- Output to JSON (2 stories). Both high relevance.
- No major tournament results or banlist updates past 48h.

## Day Work
- Reviewed user feedback on hero images; implemented improvements:
  - News posts without decklist: no hero card (gradient instead)
  - Basic lands filtered from hero selection
  - Featured-cards injection disabled for News
- Rebuilt site; committed on master.
- Fixed footer consistency across all deck pages (46 files).
- Created hub pages and trust pages; merged to master.
- Addressed "header not permanent" issue by ensuring all pages use shared footer template.

## Plans
- Continue hub content expansion.
- Monitor weekly land verification cron.

## Evening Session — Config Recovery & Automation
- Discovered agent definitions missing after partial config patches; only `automation` remained.
- Root cause: earlier `config.patch` calls overwrote `agents.list` instead of merging.
- Fix: Rebuilt full agent suite via single `config.patch` with complete list:
  - scout, writer, editor, factchecker, publisher, designer, qa, automation.
- Model routing: scout/factchecker → hermes4:405b (strongest); automation → step; publisher → coder.
- Subagent allowlists added to enable pipeline collaboration.
- Verified cron jobs: weekly land verification (Sun 3 AM UTC), daily pipeline (6 AM ET), morning digest (8 AM ET).
- Health check clean; all agents registered and operational.
- Next: optionally trigger a manual pipeline run to validate before first 6 AM execution.

## Pipeline Test & Provider Blocking
- Triggered manual pipeline run to validate automation.
- Pipeline started successfully but Scout agent hit repeated 403 blocks from Compute3 provider during web searches.
- Root cause: Compute3 is blocking outgoing API calls from this server (likely rate limit/IP restriction or quota exceeded).
- Pipeline currently retrying (3 attempts, 15s delays). Will eventually fail if blocking persists.
- Recommendation implemented: Prepared config patch to switch Scout model priority from compute3/hermes4:405b to openrouter-direct/stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free (with compute3 fallback).
- Pending user approval to apply the model routing change.

## Late Evening — Post CSS Fix

- Issue: The newly published "Arena Powered Cube Returns" post displayed with an old, light-themed CSS template that didn't match the site's dark theme.
- Root cause: The post was present in `posts/published/` but missing from `data/posts.json`, so the static site builder (`build.js`) wasn't generating it with the current template.
- Fix:
  1. Extracted the article body HTML from the old publication.
  2. Added a new entry to `data/posts.json` with the post's metadata and the extracted body HTML.
  3. Re-ran `build.js`, which generated a correctly styled HTML file using the current dark theme and layout.
  4. Copied the generated file (`posts/arena-powered-cube-returns-2026.html`) to the published dated folder (`posts/published/2026-02-14-arena-powered-cube-returns/index.html`).
- Verified: The page now matches the site's visual style (dark background, proper nav, hero section, fonts).
- Note: Other posts in the `published/` folder might still use the old template; consider rebuilding them similarly if needed.
